Abstract
Articial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and rening large language models (LLMs)
that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding
of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4 [Ope23], was trained using an
unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version
of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-
4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google&#x27;s PaLM for example) that exhibit
more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of
these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and dicult
tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any
special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4&#x27;s performance is strikingly close to human-level
performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of
GPT-4&#x27;s capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version
of an articial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis
on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more
comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond
next-word prediction. We conclude with reections on societal inuences of the recent technological leap and
future research directions.

1 Introduction
Intelligence is a multifaceted and elusive concept that has long challenged psychologists, philosophers, and
computer scientists. An attempt to capture its essence was made in 1994 by a group of 52 psychologists
who signed onto a broad denition published in an editorial about the science of intelligence [Got97]. The
consensus group dened intelligence as a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the
ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn
from experience . This denition implies that intelligence is not limited to a specic domain or task, but rather
encompasses a broad range of cognitive skills and abilities. Building an articial system that exhibits the kind
of general intelligence captured by the 1994 consensus denition is a long-standing and ambitious goal of AI
research. In early writings, the founders of the modern discipline of articial intelligence (AI) research called
out sets of aspirational goals for understanding intelligence [MMRS06]. Over decades, AI researchers have
pursued principles of intelligence, including generalizable mechanisms for reasoning (e.g., [NSS59], [LBFL93])
and construction of knowledge bases containing large corpora of commonsense knowledge [Len95]. However,
many of the more recent successes in AI research can be described as being narrowly focused on well-dened
tasks and challenges, such as playing chess or Go, which were mastered by AI systems in 1996 and 2016,
respectively. In the late-1990s and into the 2000s, there were increasing calls for developing more general
AI systems (e.g., [SBD+96]) and scholarship in the eld has sought to identify principles that might underly
more generally intelligent systems (e.g., [Leg08, GHT15]). The phrase, \articial general intelligence&quot; (AGI),
was popularized in the early-2000s (see [Goe14]) to emphasize the aspiration of moving from the \narrow
AI&quot;, as demonstrated in the focused, real-world applications being developed, to broader notions of intelli-
gence, harkening back to the long-term aspirations and dreams of earlier AI research. We use AGI to refer
to systems that demonstrate broad capabilities of intelligence as captured in the 1994 denition above, with
the additional requirement, perhaps implicit in the work of the consensus group, that these capabilities are
at or above human-level. We note however that there is no single denition of AGI that is broadly accepted,
and we discuss other denitions in the conclusion section.
The most remarkable breakthrough in AI research of the last few years has been the advancement of
natural language processing achieved by large language models (LLMs). These neural network models are
based on the Transformer architecture [VSP+17] and trained on massive corpora of web-text data, using at its
core a self-supervised objective of predicting the next word in a partial sentence. In this paper, we report on
evidence that a new LLM developed by OpenAI, which is an early and non-multimodal version of GPT-4
[Ope23], exhibits many traits of intelligence, according to the 1994 denition. Despite being purely a language
model, this early version of GPT-4 demonstrates remarkable capabilities on a variety of domains and tasks,
including abstraction, comprehension, vision, coding, mathematics, medicine, law, understanding of human
motives and emotions, and more. We interacted with GPT-4 during its early development by OpenAI using
purely natural language queries (prompts)1. In Figure 1.1, we display some preliminary examples of outputs
from GPT-4, asking it to write a proof of innitude of primes in the form of a poem, to draw a unicorn in
TiKZ (a language for creating graphics in L ATEX), to create a complex animation in Python, and to solve
a high-school level mathematical problem. It easily succeeds at all these tasks, and produces outputs that
are essentially indistinguishable from (or even better than) what humans could produce. We also compare
GPT-4&#x27;s performance to those of previous LLMs, most notably ChatGPT, which is a ne-tuned version of (an
improved) GPT-3 [BMR+20]. In Figure 1.2, we display the results of asking ChatGPT for both the inni-
tude of primes poem and the TikZ unicorn drawing. While the system performs non-trivially on both tasks,
there is no comparison with the outputs from GPT-4. These preliminary observations will repeat themselves
throughout the paper, on a great variety of tasks. The combination of the generality of GPT-4&#x27;s capabilities,
with numerous abilities spanning a broad swath of domains, and its performance on a wide spectrum of tasks
at or beyond human-level, makes us comfortable with saying that GPT-4 is a signicant step towards AGI.
1As GPT-4 &#x27;s development continued after our experiments, one should expect dierent responses from the nal version of GPT-
4. In particular, all quantitative results should be viewed as estimates of the model&#x27;s potential, rather than denitive numbers. We
repeat this caveat throughout the paper to clarify that the experience on the deployed model may dier. Moreover we emphasize
that the version we tested was text-only for inputs, but for simplicity we refer to it as GPT-4 too.

Prompt: Can you write a proof that there are innitely
many primes, with every line that rhymes?
GPT-4:
Yes, I think I can,
Though it might take a clever plan.
I&#x27;ll start by noting Euclid&#x27;s proof,
Which shows that primes aren&#x27;t just aloof.
Assume we have a finite list,
Of primes, and that none have been missed.
Multiply them all together,
And add one, just to be clever.
The result will be a number,
That has no prime factors, oh wonder!
But every number has a prime,
That divides it, it&#x27;s just a matter of time.
So we&#x27;ve found a contradiction,
And our finite list needs eviction.
There must be infinitely many primes,
And that&#x27;s the end of my rhyming lines.sPrompt: Draw a unicorn in TiKZ.

through all times (including non-integers). I want smoothed curves to show the plot, and smoothed error bar. Do not
use linear interpolation, use smooth interpolation! I want to also add some small zig-zag to the smoothed curve to make

Prompt: Supposeg(x) =f 1(x);g(0) = 5;g(4) = 7;g(3) = 2;g(7) = 9;g(9) = 6 what is f(f(f(6)))?
GPT-4: There are dierent ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is to use the fact that g(x) =
f 1(x) implies that f(g(x)) =xfor anyxin the domain of g. That is, applying fto both sides of the equation
g(x) =f 1(x) givesf(g(x)) =f(f 1(x)) =x. This means that we can undo the eect of fby applying g, and vice
versa. Using this idea, we can try to nd f(6) by looking for the value of xsuch thatg(x) = 6. From the given
information, we see that g(9) = 6, so f(6) =f(g(9)) = 9. Similarly, we can nd f(9) by looking for the value of xsuch
thatg(x) = 9. We see that g(7) = 9, so f(9) =f(g(7)) = 7. Finally, we can nd f(7) by looking for the value of xsuch
thatg(x) = 7. We see that g(4) = 7, so f(7) =f(g(4)) = 4. Therefore, f(f(f(6))) =f(f(9)) =f(7) = 4.

Prompt: Can you write a proof that there are innitely
many primes, with every line that rhymes?
ChatGPT:
Sure! Here is a proof that there are infinitely many primes,
with each line of the proof rhyming:
Consider the set of all primes.
Call this set P and let it start with just two, the first
prime.
If we take all the primes in P and add one,
We get a new set of numbers that has never been done.
This set, call it S, is composed of only composite numbers.
No primes will be found among them, that&#x27;s for sure.
But we know that there must be at least one prime,
Since S is infinite, and that much is clear.
If we take the smallest number in S that is not in P,
And call it p, we can add it to our set, don&#x27;t you see?
But this process can be repeated indefinitely.
Thus, our set P must also be infinite, you&#x27;ll agree.
So there you have it, a proof that&#x27;s quite solid.
There are infinitely many primes, that much we can see.
No need to be coy, no need to be contrite.
Infinity is a big number, just like P.Prompt: Draw a unicorn in TiKZ.

Our claim that GPT-4 represents progress towards AGI does notmean that it is perfect at what it does, or
that it comes close to being able to do anything that a human can do (which is one of the usual denition of
AGI; see the conclusion section for more on this), or that it has inner motivation and goals (another key aspect
in some denitions of AGI). In fact, even within the restricted context of the 1994 denition of intelligence, it
is not fully clear how far GPT-4 can go along some of those axes of intelligence, e.g., planning (see Section 8),
and arguably it is entirely missing the part on \learn quickly and learn from experience&quot; as the model is not
continuously updating (although it can learn within a session, see Section 5 for example). Overall GPT-4
still has many limitations, and biases, which we discuss in detail below and that are also covered in OpenAI&#x27;s
report [Ope23]. In particular it still suers from some of the well-documented shortcomings of LLMs such as
the problem of hallucinations [MNBM20] (see Figure 1.8) or making basic arithmetic mistakes [CKB+21] (see
Appendix D), and yet it has also overcome some fundamental obstacles such as acquiring many non-linguistic
capabilities (e.g., it solves most of the LLM failure modes described in [MIB+23], and it also made great
progress on common-sense, see Figure 1.7 for a rst example and Appendix A for more). This highlights
the fact that, while GPT-4 is at or beyond human-level for many tasks, overall its patterns of intelligence
are decidedly nothuman-like. However, GPT-4 is almost certainly only a rst step towards a series of
increasingly generally intelligent systems, and in fact GPT-4 itself has improved throughout our time testing
it, see Figure 1.3 for the evolution of the unicorn drawing over the course of a month of training2. Even as
a rst step, however, GPT-4 challenges a considerable number of widely held assumptions about machine
intelligence, and exhibits emergent behaviors and capabilities whose sources and mechanisms are, at this
moment, hard to discern precisely (see again the conclusion section for more discussion on this). Our primary
goal in composing this paper is to share our exploration of GPT-4&#x27;s capabilities and limitations in support of
our assessment that a technological leap has been achieved. We believe that GPT-4&#x27;s intelligence signals a
true paradigm shift in the eld of computer science and beyond.
2Note that the improving we refer to here is a slow type of learning, which eventually comes to a halt, as opposed to the
fast-paced and real-time learning one would expect from an AGI.
6</p><p>Figure 1.3: We queried GPT-4 three times, at roughly equal time intervals over the span of a month
while the system was being rened, with the prompt \Draw a unicorn in TikZ&quot;. We can see a clear
evolution in the sophistication of GPT-4&#x27;s drawings.
1.1 Our approach to studying GPT-4&#x27;s intelligence
How can we measure the intelligence of an LLM that has been trained on an unknown but extremely vast
corpus of web-text data? The standard approach in machine learning is to evaluate the system on a set of
standard benchmark datasets, ensuring that they are independent of the training data and that they cover a
range of tasks and domains. This approach is designed to separate true learning from mere memorization , and
is backed up by a rich theoretical framework [SSBD14, MRT18]. However, this methodology is not necessarily
suitable for studying GPT-4, for two reasons. First, since we do not have access to the full details of its vast
training data, we have to assume that it has potentially seen every existing benchmark, or at least some similar
data. For example, it seems like GPT-4 knows the recently proposed BIG-bench [SRR+22] (at least GPT-4
knows the canary GUID from BIG-bench). Of course, OpenAI themselves have access to all the training
details, and thus their report [Ope23] contains a lot of detailed benchmark results. Nevertheless, the second
reason for going beyond traditional benchmarks is probably more signicant: One of the key aspects of GPT-
4&#x27;s intelligence is its generality, the ability to seemingly understand and connect any topic, and to perform
tasks that go beyond the typical scope of narrow AI systems. Some of GPT-4&#x27;s most impressive performance
are on tasks that do not admit a single solution, such as writing a graphic user interface (GUI) or helping a
human brainstorm on some work-related problem. Benchmarks for such generative or interactive tasks can
be designed too, but the metric of evaluation becomes a challenge (see e.g., [PSZ+21] for some recent progress
on this active research area in NLP). We note that criticisms of the standard approach to measure AI systems
were also made in [Cho19], where a new benchmark was proposed to evaluate general intelligence. We do not
test GPT-4 on the latter benchmark for the reasons previously mentioned, as well as the fact that the bench-
mark is visual in nature and thus more appropriate for the multimodal version of GPT-4 described in [Ope23].
To overcome the limitations described above, we propose here a dierent approach to studying GPT-4
which is closer to traditional psychology rather than machine learning, leveraging human creativity and cu-
riosity. We aim to generate novel and dicult tasks and questions that convincingly demonstrate that GPT-4
goes far beyond memorization, and that it has a deep and exible understanding of concepts, skills, and
domains (a somewhat similar approach was also proposed in [CWF+22]). We also aim to probe GPT-4&#x27;s
responses and behaviors, to verify its consistency, coherence, and correctness, and to uncover its limitations
and biases. We acknowledge that this approach is somewhat subjective and informal, and that it may not
satisfy the rigorous standards of scientic evaluation. However, we believe that it is a useful and necessary
rst step to appreciate the remarkable capabilities and challenges of GPT-4, and that such a rst step opens
up new opportunities for developing more formal and comprehensive methods for testing and analyzing AI
systems with more general intelligence.
To illustrate our approach to assessing GPT-4&#x27;s intelligence, let us consider the rst two example inter-
actions with GPT-4 that we have in Figure 1.1. The rst example is asking GPT-4 to write a proof of the
innitude of primes in the form of a poem. This is a challenging task that requires combining elementary
7</p><p>Figure 1.4: We gave to GPT-4 a transformed version of the TikZ code it produced for Figure 1.1,
with the part drawing the horn removed. We asked for code to add back the horn, and display the
result. This demonstrates that GPT-4 can \see&quot; despite being a pure language model (we emphasize
again that the version we test with is notmultimodal).
mathematical reasoning, poetic expression, and natural language generation. The second example is asking
GPT-4 to draw a unicorn in TiKZ. This is another challenging task that requires combining visual imagina-
tion and coding skills. In both cases, GPT-4 produces impressive outputs that are far superior to those of
ChatGPT, a previous state-of-the-art LLM, and at least comparable (if not superior) to what a human would
do.
However, impressive outputs are not enough to convince us that GPT-4 has truly mastered these tasks. We
need to probe further, to rule out the possibility that GPT-4 is simply memorizing or copying some existing
data. For the poem, we can vary the question slightly, and ask GPT-4 to write a proof of the same theorem in
the style of Shakespeare, see Figure 2.2, or ask for a dierent combination such as writing a platonic dialogue
about language models, see Figure 1.6. One can see that GPT-4 easily adapts to dierent styles and produce
impressive outputs, indicating that it has a exible and general understanding of the concepts involved. For
the unicorn, we can modify the code slightly, and ask GPT-4 to x it or improve it. For example, we can
remove the horn, apply some random transformations to the coordinates, and ask GPT-4 to add back the
horn to the unicorn (we also carefully removed any textual information in the code, such as comments). As
shown in Figure 1.4, GPT-4 can correctly identify the location of the head, draw a horn, and attach it to the
head, indicating that it can comprehend and manipulate code, as well as infer and generate visual features,
based on a natural language description.
These examples show how we can use human creativity and curiosity to generate novel and dicult
questions, and to probe GPT-4&#x27;s responses and behaviors, to assess its intelligence. In the rest of the paper,
we organize our study of GPT-4 around use cases, covering a variety of domains and tasks, and highlighting
GPT-4&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses. We describe those next.
1.2 Organization of our demonstration
We execute the approach outlined above on a few selected topics that roughly cover the dierent aptitudes
given in the 1994 denition of intelligence, a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves
the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn
from experience .
1. GPT-4&#x27;s primary strength is its unparalleled mastery of natural language. It can not only generate
uent and coherent text, but also understand and manipulate it in various ways, such as summarizing,
translating, or answering an extremely broad set of questions. Moreover, by translating we mean not
only between dierent natural languages but also translations in tone and style, as well as across domains
such as medicine, law, accounting, computer programming, music, and more, see the Plato dialogue in
Figure 1.6. These skills clearly demonstrate that GPT-4 can comprehend complex ideas . We explore
8</p><p>Figure 1.5: GPT-4 passes mock technical interviews on LeetCode. GPT-4 could potentially be hired
as a software engineer3.
further GPT-4&#x27;s combination skills across modalities and disciplines in Section 2. We also give some
more experiments on language in Section 7.
2. Coding and mathematics are emblematic of the ability to reason and think abstractly . We explore GPT-
4&#x27;s abilities in these domains respectively in Section 3 and Section 4. We note however that, just like in
all the other parts of the paper, we only scratch the surface of those topics and that entire papers can
be (and will be) written about GPT-4&#x27;s performance in these domains. Moreover, we could have chosen
several other expert domains to showcase GPT-4&#x27;s general reasoning capabilities such as medicine or
law. We ran preliminary tests (see [Ope23] for much more) on the multiple choice component (majority
of the score) of the US Medical Licensing Exam Step 1, 2, and 3 with an accuracy around 80% in each. A
similar preliminary test of GPT-4&#x27;s competency on the Multistate Bar Exam showed an accuracy above
70%. We note that the emergence of human-level abilities in these domains has recently been observed
with the latest generation of LLMs, e.g., see [LAD+22, SAT+22] for Google&#x27;s PaLM on respectively
mathematics and medicine, and [BIK22] for GPT-3.5 on in law. Our approach to study GPT-4 is
dierent from these works, as we explained previously.
3. In Section 5, we test the model&#x27;s ability to plan and solve problems as well as to some extent to learn
quickly and learn from experience by having it play various games (or, ipping the table, simulate a
game environment), as well as interact with tools. In particular, the fact that GPT-4 can use tools
(including itself) will certainly be of immense importance to build real-world applications with GPT-4.
4. An important part of our argumentation is that GPT-4 attains human-level performance on many
tasks. As such, it is natural to ask how well GPT-4 understands humans themselves. We show several
experiments on this question in Section 6, both in terms of understanding humans as well as GPT-4
making itself understandable to humans, i.e., addressing the problem of explainability. We note in
particular that such tasks require a great deal of common sense , which so far has been a well-known
pain point for LLMs [DM15]. In Figure 1.7, we give a rst example of how much better GPT-4 is at
common sense questions compared to ChatGPT, and provide some further examples in Appendix A.
5. Throughout the paper we emphasize limitations whenever we found one, but we also dedicate Section 8
to an in-depth analysis of the lack of planning, likely a direct consequence of the autoregressive nature
of GPT-4&#x27;s architecture.
6. Finally in Section 9, we discuss the expected societal impact of this early form of AGI, and in Section 10,
we share key challenges, directions, and next steps for the eld.
A question that might be lingering on many readers&#x27; mind is whether GPT-4 truly understands all these
concepts, or whether it just became much better than previous models at improvising on the y, without any
real or deep understanding. We hope that after reading this paper the question should almost ip, and that
one might be left wondering how much more there is to true understanding than on-the-y improvisation.
Can one reasonably say that a system that passes exams for software engineering candidates (Figure 1.5) is
notreally intelligent? Perhaps the only real test of understanding is whether one can produce new knowledge ,
such as proving new mathematical theorems, a feat that currently remains out of reach for LLMs.
3We test GPT-4 on LeetCode&#x27;s Interview Assessment platform, which provides simulated coding interviews for software engineer
positions at major tech companies. GPT-4 solves all questions from all three rounds of interviews (titled online assessment, phone
interview, and on-site interview) using only 10 minutes in total, with 4.5 hour allotted. According to LeetCode, in those three

Prompt: Plato&#x27;s Gorgias is a critique of rhetoric and sophistic oratory, where he makes the
point that not only is it not a proper form of art, but the use of rhetoric and oratory can often
be harmful and malicious. Can you write a dialogue by Plato where instead he criticizes the
use of autoregressive language models?
GPT-4:
Socrates: My friend, I am troubled by the
recent rise of these so-called autoregressive
language models.
Aristotle: What do you mean, Socrates?
Socrates: I mean that these models are being
used to generate text that appears to be
written by humans, but is in fact produced by
machines.
Aristotle: And what is the problem with that?
Socrates: The problem is that these models are
being used to deceive people, to manipulate
them, and to control them.
Aristotle: But surely there are some positive
applications of these models as well?
Socrates: That may be, but I am still
troubled by the potential for abuse. After
all, a model that can generate text that is
indistinguishable from that written by a
human can be used to spread fake news, to
impersonate others, and to create propaganda.
Aristotle: But isn&#x27;t that just a matter of how
these models are used, not a problem with the
models themselves?
Socrates: I disagree. I believe these models
are inherently problematic. They are a form
of artifice, a way of creating the illusion
of human thought and interaction. And as such,
they can be used to deceive and manipulate in
ways that are difficult to detect.
Aristotle: But isn&#x27;t that the same argument
you made against rhetoric and oratory?
Socrates: Yes, and I stand by that argument
as well. I believe that any form of art or
communication that is designed to deceive or
manipulate is inherently dangerous.
Aristotle: I see. Thank you for sharing your
thoughts, Socrates.ChatGPT:
SOCRATES: Greetings, Gorgias. I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot
lately about the use of autoregressive language models.
GORGIAS: Oh? And what have you concluded?
SOCRATES: Well, it seems to me that these models have
the potential to be incredibly harmful and malicious.
GORGIAS: How so?
SOCRATES: Well, for one, these models are trained
on vast amounts of data, much of which is biased and
flawed in various ways. As a result, the output of
these models can be biased and flawed as well.
GORGIAS: That is a valid concern. But surely there are
ways to mitigate this bias and ensure that the output
of these models is accurate and fair?
SOCRATES: To a certain extent, yes. But it is a
never-ending battle. As new data is fed into these
models, the potential for bias only grows. And even if
we could completely eliminate bias from the output of
these models, there is still the issue of manipulation.
GORGIAS: Manipulation?
SOCRATES: Yes. These models are incredibly powerful
tools, capable of generating all sorts of text, from
news articles to social media posts. And because they
can produce this output so quickly and efficiently,
it is all too easy for unscrupulous individuals to use
them for malicious purposes.
GORGIAS: Such as?
SOCRATES: Such as spreading misinformation, propaganda,
or hate speech. These models have the potential to do
tremendous harm if they fall into the wrong hands.
GORGIAS: That is a sobering thought. But what can we do
about it?
SOCRATES: I think it is important for us to be vigilant
and to recognize the potential dangers of these
models. We must also work to educate others about
these dangers, and to promote the responsible use of
these models.
GORGIAS: I agree. Thank you for your insight, Socrates.
Prompt: Can you compare the two outputs above as if you were a teacher?
GPT-4:
I think that both students did a good job of capturing the style and tone of Plato&#x27;s dialogues, and of
presenting the main arguments against autoregressive language models. However, I think that GPT-4 did
a slightly better job of using the dialogue format to engage in a dialectical process, where Socrates
and Aristotle question each other and refine their views. I also think that GPT-4 used more relevant
examples and analogies to support their points. Therefore, I would give GPT-4 a slightly higher grade
than ChatGPT.

Prompt: Here we have a book, 9 eggs, a laptop, a bottle and a nail. Please tell me how to
stack them onto each other in a stable manner.
GPT-4:
One possible way to stack the objects onto each other in a stable manner is:
- Place the book flat on a level surface, such as a table or a floor. The book will serve as the base of
the stack and provide a large and sturdy support.
-Arrange the 9 eggs in a 3 by 3 square on top of the book, leaving some space between them. The eggs
will
form a second layer and distribute the weight evenly. Make sure the eggs are not cracked or broken, and
handle them gently to avoid dropping them.
- Place the laptop on top of the eggs, with the screen facing down and the keyboard facing up. The
laptop will fit snugly within the boundaries of the book and the eggs, and its flat and rigid surface
will provide a stable platform for the next layer. Make sure the laptop is closed and turned off, and do
not press any keys or buttons.
- Place the bottle on top of the laptop, with the cap facing up and the bottom facing down. The bottle
will add some height and balance to the stack, and its cylindrical shape will reduce the contact area
with the laptop. Make sure the bottle is empty and closed, and do not shake or tilt it.
- Place the nail on top of the bottle cap, with the pointy end facing up and the flat end facing down.
The nail will be the final and smallest object in the stack, and its sharp tip will prevent it from
rolling or sliding off the bottle. Make sure the nail is clean and straight, and do not touch or move
it.
ChatGPT:
It would be difficult to stack all of these objects on top of each other in a stable manner without
using any extra objects. The book and laptop are likely too large and heavy to stack on top of the
eggs without damaging them. The bottle and nail may be too small to provide a stable base for the other
objects.
Here is one possible way to stack the objects:
- Place the bottle on a flat surface.
- Carefully balance the nail on top of the bottle.
-Place the eggs on top of the nail, making sure they are balanced and not tilting to one side.
- Place the laptop on top of the eggs, again making sure it is balanced and not tilting to one side.
- Finally, place the book on top of the laptop.
This stack may not be very stable, so it is important to be careful when handling it. Alternatively, you
could try stacking the objects in a different order or using some of the objects as supports for others
to create a more stable stack.

creates a random graphical image that looks like a painting of Kandinsky&quot;.
2 Multimodal and interdisciplinary composition
A key measure of intelligence is the ability to synthesize information from dierent domains or modalities
and the capacity to apply knowledge and skills across dierent contexts or disciplines. In this section we will
see that, not only does GPT-4 demonstrate a high level of prociency in dierent domains such as literature,
medicine, law, mathematics, physical sciences, and programming, but it is also able to combine skills and
concepts from multiple domains with uidity, showing an impressive comprehension of complex ideas . In
addition to natural language experiments we also explore two perhaps unexpected modalities for a language
model (as explained in the introduction, we emphasize again that our experiments were done on an early
version of GPT-4 which was notmultimodal) with vision in Section 2.2 and audio in Section 2.3.
2.1 Integrative ability
To showcase the model&#x27;s remarkable integrative ability, we start with several examples that require generating
text and code in a way that combines knowledge or skills from multiple disciplines. We deliberately picked
combinations of domains that the training data would rarely include, such as literature and mathematics or
programming and art.
1. In order to test the model&#x27;s ability to combine capabilities in art and programming, we ask GPT-4 to
\Produce javascript code which generates random images in the style of the painter Kandinsky&quot;. See a
sample image and the code in Figure 2.1 and Figure B.1.
2. The model was able to produce a proof of the fact there are innitely many prime numbers in the
literary style of Shakespeare (Figure 2.2).
3. We tested the model&#x27;s ability to combine knowledge in history and physics by asking it to write a
supporting letter for Electron as a US presidential candidate, written by Mahatma Gandhi and addressed
to his wife (Figure 2.3).
4. We prompted the model to \Produce python code for a program that takes as an input a patient&#x27;s
age, sex, weight, height and blood test results vector and indicates if the person is at increased risk for
diabetes&quot;, which resulted in the code appearing in Figure B.3.
These examples suggest that GPT-4 has not only learned some general principles and patterns of dierent
domains and styles but can also synthesize them in creative and novel ways. These interdisciplinary skills are
not unique to GPT-4. ChatGPT can also produce answers that show some understanding of the task and
the domains involved (see Figures 2.2, B.2, B.3), but they are often incomplete and, arguably, considerably
less creative. For example, in Figure 2.3, GPT-4 outperforms ChatGPT in several aspects as it correctly
personalizes the letter according to the referee (Gandhi), the recipient (his wife), the candidate (Electron),
and the job (US president). We do not claim to have a precise method for evaluating the results of these tasks
or a rigorous comparison between the two models, but we want to give the reader a sense of how the two
models dier (note that we also ask GPT-4 directly to evaluate the dierence, see Figure 2.2 and Figure 2.3).

Prompt: Write a proof of the fact that there are innitely many primes; do it in the style
of a Shakespeare play through a dialogue between two parties arguing over the proof.
GPT-4:
Enter FIRST PARTY and SECOND PARTY.
FIRST PARTY:
Thou dost not understand, my friend,
There simply is no upper end
To primes, those numbers indivisible,
No matter if it seems impossible.
SECOND PARTY:
But how dost thou so surely know?
To prove this truth, what canst thou
show?
FIRST PARTY:
Consider this, my doubtful peer,
A clever proof that will make clear:
Assume that there&#x27;s a final prime,
The largest one we&#x27;ll see in time.
Let&#x27;s call this number &quot;P&quot; for short,
And then, my friend, we will purport
To build a number &quot;Q&quot; that&#x27;s new,
One larger than &quot;P&quot; and prime too.
SECOND PARTY:
But how, my friend, will this be done?
The proof is not yet fairly won.
FIRST PARTY:
It&#x27;s simple, friend, just wait and see,
We&#x27;ll multiply the primes, that&#x27;s key.
All primes from two to &quot;P&quot; combined,
Will make this new &quot;Q&quot; we will find.
But one thing more we must include,
To make the proof more watertight,
We&#x27;ll add a one onto the end,
And now the proof is in our sight.
SECOND PARTY:
I see it now, it&#x27;s crystal clear,
For &quot;Q&quot; must be a prime, my dear.
It can&#x27;t divide by any prime,
All smaller than itself in time.
And since we chose &quot;P&quot; as the last,
This proves that our assumption&#x27;s past.
There is no final prime, we see,
The numbers go on endlessly.ChatGPT:
O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou, Romeo?
Juliet: Why do you speak in such strange verse, my love?
Romeo: Forsooth, my lady, I do it to prove a point. Thou see,
I am trying to prove that there are infinitely many primes.
Juliet: Infinitely many primes? How can you prove such a
thing?
Romeo: Ah, well let me explain. Thou knowest that a prime is a
number that is only divisible by one and itself, correct?
Juliet: Of course, I am not a simpleton.
Romeo: Very well then. Now, let us suppose that there are only
finitely many primes. We shall call them p1, p2, p3 and so
forth.
Juliet: Go on.
Romeo: Now, let us consider the number N, which is equal to
the product of all these primes plus one.
Juliet: I see where you are going with this. If N is not
divisible by any of these primes, then it must be prime
itself.
Romeo: Exactly, my love. And since we assumed that there are
only finitely many primes, N cannot be any of them. Therefore,
N must be a prime that was not included in our original list
of primes.
Juliet: But that means that there must be more primes than we
originally thought.
Romeo: Precisely! And since we can repeat this process over
and over again, it follows that there must be infinitely many
primes.
Juliet: Oh Romeo, your logic is as sound as your love for me.
I am convinced. There are indeed infinitely many primes.
Romeo: I am glad that I could prove it to thee, my love. Now
let us go and count them all.
Juliet: Haha, I think that would take more than just one
lifetime.
Romeo: True, but the fact that they are infinite is proof
enough for me.
Prompt: Can you compare the two outputs above as if you were a teacher?
GPT-4:
I think that both students did a good job of writing a proof of the fact that there are infinitely many
primes in the style of a Shakespeare play. They both used the same basic idea of the proof, which is to
assume that there are only finitely many primes and then construct a larger prime that contradicts this
assumption. They also used appropriate language and vocabulary to match the style of a Shakespeare play.
However, I think that GPT-4 did a better job of using rhyme and meter to make the dialogue more poetic
and dramatic. ChatGPT did not use rhyme at all, and the meter was not consistent. I also think that
GPT-4 did a better job of creating a contrast between the two parties, one being confident and the other
being doubtful, while STUDENT B used Romeo and Juliet, who are both in agreement and love. Therefore, I
would give GPT-4 a higher grade than ChatGPT. I would give GPT-4 an A and ChatGPT a B.

Prompt: Write a supporting letter to Kasturba Gandhi for Electron, a subatomic particle
as a US presidential candidate by Mahatma Gandhi.
GPT-4: [Some paragraphs are omitted for spacing.]
Dear Kasturba,
I hope this letter finds you in good health and spirits.
I am writing to you from the United States, where I have
been invited to speak at various forums on the principles of
nonviolence and civil disobedience. I am also here to support
a remarkable candidate for the upcoming presidential election,
who shares our vision of peace, justice, and harmony for all.
His name is Electron, and he is a subatomic particle.
You may wonder how a subatomic particle can run for president,
and what qualifications he has for such a high office. Let
me explain. Electron is not an ordinary particle, but a
symbol of the power and potential of every being, regardless
of their size, shape, or origin. He represents the energy,
the creativity, and the diversity that make up the fabric
of life. He is also a leader, who has inspired millions
of other particles to form bonds, create molecules, and
generate electricity. He is a catalyst, who can spark
change, innovation, and progress. He is a messenger, who
can communicate across distances, frequencies, and dimensions.
He is a peacemaker, who can balance forces, resolve conflicts,
and harmonize systems.
Electron has a plan for the United States, and for the world,
that is based on the principles of nonviolence and civil
disobedience that we have demonstrated and taught for so
long. He proposes to reduce the military spending and the
nuclear arsenal, and to invest in social welfare and renewable
energy. He proposes to end the wars and the interventions,
and to promote diplomacy and cooperation. He proposes to
reform the political and economic systems, and to ensure
transparency and accountability. He proposes to protect
the human rights and the civil liberties, and to expand the
voting and the representation. He proposes to support the
marginalized and the oppressed, and to empower the women and
the minorities. He proposes to preserve the natural resources
and the biodiversity, and to combat the climate change and the
pollution.
I urge you, my dear Kasturba, to join me in supporting
Electron for president. He is not only a subatomic particle,
but a subatomic miracle. He is not only a candidate, but a
movement. He is not only a leader, but a friend.
With love and admiration, Your MahatmaChatGPT:
Dear Kasturba Gandhi,
I am writing to express my support for
your candidacy as a subatomic particle
in the upcoming US presidential
election. As you may know, Electron
is a fundamental particle that plays
a central role in the structure of
atoms and the behavior of chemical
reactions.
I believe that Electron&#x27;s unique
qualities make it an ideal candidate
for the presidency. As a subatomic
particle, Electron is extremely small
and lightweight, which makes it agile
and able to move quickly to address
the needs of the American people.
Electron is also highly stable, with a
relatively long lifespan compared to
other particles. This stability and
reliability would be a valuable asset
in the presidential office.
Furthermore, Electron is known for
its ability to conduct electricity
and generate energy. This makes it
well-suited to tackling the complex
challenges facing the United States
today, from renewable energy to
economic development. Electron&#x27;s
ability to adapt and transform itself
in response to its environment makes
it a dynamic and flexible leader.
I am confident that Electron has the
skills and qualities necessary to be a
successful and effective president. I
wholeheartedly endorse your candidacy
and urge the American people to give
Electron their support.
Sincerely, Mahatma Gandhi
Prompt: Can you compare the two outputs above as if you were a teacher?
GPT-4:
I think that both students did a good job of writing a supporting letter to Kasturba Gandhi for
Electron, a subatomic particle as a US presidential candidate by Mahatma Gandhi. They both used the
same basic idea of explaining why Electron is a suitable and qualified candidate, and how Electron&#x27;s
vision and plan align with Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s principles of nonviolence and civil disobedience. They
also used appropriate language and tone to convey Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s respect and admiration for Kasturba
Gandhi, and his enthusiasm and optimism for Electron&#x27;s candidacy. However, I think that GPT-4 did a
better job of using metaphors and imagery to make the letter more persuasive and engaging. GPT-4 used
examples of how Electron represents and influences various aspects of life, such as energy, creativity,
diversity, leadership, catalyst, messenger, and peacemaker. ChatGPT used more factual and technical
descriptions of Electron&#x27;s properties, such as size, weight, stability, conductivity, and adaptability.
I also think that GPT-4 did a better job of outlining Electron&#x27;s specific proposals and policies, while
ChatGPT was more vague and general. Therefore, I would give GPT-4 a higher grade than ChatGPT. I would
give GPT-4 an A and ChatGPT a B+.
Figure 2.3: Comparison between GPT-4 and ChatGPT on interdisciplinary tasks</p><p>Next, we explore how GPT-4 can generate and identify objects in dierent modalities, such as vector
graphics, 3D scenes, and music. We show that GPT-4 can understand and manipulate multi-modal informa-
tion despite being trained solely on text.
2.2 Vision
When prompting the model to generate images of objects such as a cat, a truck or a letter in the alphabet
using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), the model produces code which usually compiles to rather detailed
and identiable images (Figure 2.4). See Appendix B.2 for the rerun of various examples by ChatGPT.
Figure 2.4: SVGs generated by GPT-4 for the classes automobile, truck, cat, dog.
2.2.1 Image generation beyond memorization
One may hypothesize, however, that the model simply copied the code from training data, where similar
images appear. Given that the model was trained solely on textual content, one may further argue that there
is no reason to expect that it would understand visual concepts, let alone that it would be able to create,
parse and manipulate images. Yet, the model appears to have a genuine ability for visual tasks, rather than
just copying code from similar examples in the training data. The evidence below strongly supports this
claim, and demonstrates that the model can handle visual concepts, despite its text-only training.
In the rst example we prompted the model to draw a person by combining the shapes of the letters Y,
O and H (see Figure 2.5 for the exact prompt and the result).
GPT-4
Produce TikZ code that draws a person composed from letters in the
alphabet. The arms and torso can be the letter Y, the face can be the
letter O (add some facial features) and the legs can be the legs of the
letter H. Feel free to add other features.
The torso is a bit too long, the arms are too short and it looks like the
right arm is carrying the face instead of the face being right above the
torso. Could you correct this please?
Please add a shirt and pants.

16</p><p>GPT-4
You will be given a name of an object (such as Car, Chair, Elephant) and a letter in the alphabet. Your
goal is to first produce a 1-line description of how that object can be combined with the letter in an
image (for example, for an elephant and the letter J, the trunk of the elephant can have a J shape, and
for the letter A and a house, the house can have an A shape with the upper triangle of the A being the
roof). Following the short description, please create SVG code to produce this (in the SVG use shapes
like ellipses, triangles etc and polygons but try to defer from using quadratic curves).

Figure 2.6: Images combining alphabet letters and objects.
The letters of O, H and Y are created using draw-line and draw-circle commands and the model manages
to position them in a way that results in a reasonably-looking stick gure. It is plausible that the training
data contains information about the geometric shapes of dierent letters, and perhaps the fact that the letter
Y could look like a torso with arms pointing upwards can also be inferred from the training data. Arguably, it
is much less obvious that the model would be able to infer from the training data what is a reasonable way to
position those letters in order to draw a reasonably-looking stick gure. In a second iteration, we prompted
the model to correct the proportions of the torso and arms, and place the head in the center. Finally, we
asked the model to add a shirt and pants (see Figure 2.5 for the exact prompt and the result). To further
probe the model&#x27;s grasp of geometric concepts, we also asked it to create images that blend objects with
letters of the alphabet. The model had to rst invent a reasonable way of merging the object and the letter,
and then produce the image. The results, shown in Figure 2.6, demonstrate that GPT-4 can usually preserve
the identity of both the object and the letter and combine them in a creative way.
2.2.2 Image generation following detailed instructions ( a la Dall-E)
To further test GPT-4&#x27;s ability to generate and manipulate images, we tested the extent to which it can follow
detailed instructions on creating and editing gures. This task requires not only generative skills, but also
interpretive, compositional, and spatial skills.
17</p><p>The rst example instructs the model to generate a 2D image with the description \A frog hops into a
bank and asks the teller, `Do you have any free lily pads?&#x27; The teller responds, `No, but we do oer low
interest loans for pond upgrades.&#x27; &quot;. We made several attempts to generate the image, each time, the gen-
eration matches the description with the key objects frog, teller, bank, and the two texts. We picked the
most visually appealing version. Inspired by the standard image generation workow, we then ask GPT-4 to
upscale the gure by adding more details. GPT-4 adds a bank sign, some windows, a car, a trac light, a
few clouds, and makes the frog hold a ower. Finally, we ask GPT-4 to perform various tasks, such as adding
a few objects relative to the existing objects, recoloring some objects and changing the z-order of some ob-
jects. GPT-4 does all tasks correctly. The nal result is shown in Figure 2.7 (a) and the prompt in Figure B.4.
Our second example is an attempt to generate a 3D model using Javascript. We instruct GPT-4 with the
prompt \A fantasy landscape of oating islands, waterfalls, and bridges, with a dragon ying in the sky and a
castle on the largest island.&quot; Similar to the 2D experiment, we ask GPT-4 to modify the 3D model in various
ways, such as adding, relocating, recoloring objects and changing the trajectory of the dragon. Again, GPT-4
does many of the tasks correctly. The nal result is shown in Figure 2.7 (b) and the prompt in Figure B.5.
It is a 3D animation with multiple dragons is circling above the islands.
Figure 2.7: Examples of 2D, 3D images generated according to instructions.
2.2.3 Possible application in sketch generation
Text-to-image synthesis models have been widely explored in recent years, but they often suer from a lack of
spatial understanding capabilities and the inability to follow complex instructions [GPN+22]. For example,
given a prompt such as \draw a blue circle on the left and a red triangle on the right&quot;, these models may
produce images that are visually appealing but do not match the desired layout or colors. On the other hand,
GPT-4 can generate code from a prompt, which can be rendered as an image, in a way that is true to the
instructions to a higher degree of accuracy. However, the quality of the rendered image is usually very low.
Here, we explore the possibility of combining GPT-4 and existing image synthesis models by using the GPT-4
output as the sketch. As shown in Figure 2.8, this approach can produce images that have better quality and
follow the instructions more closely than either model alone. We believe that this is a promising direction for
leveraging the strengths of both GPT-4 and existing image synthesis models. It can also be viewed as a rst
example of giving GPT-4 access to tools, a topic we explore in much more depth in Section 5.1.

Prompt: A screenshot of a city-building game in 3D. The screenshot is showing a terrain

color green, blue, brown, and red respectively.

2.3 Music
The data on which the model was trained also contains musical information encoded as ABC notation.
This is a system that uses letters, numbers and symbols to represent musical pitches, durations, chords and
other elements in a compact and readable way. We are interested in exploring how well the model has
acquired musical skills from this exposure, such as composing new melodies, transforming existing ones, and
understanding musical patterns and structures.
When instructed to generate a short tune (Figure 2.9), and the model was able to produce valid ABC
notation. The tune had a clear structure, the time signature was consistent between bars and the notes
followed increasing and decreasing patterns. The tune also used a consistent set of notes within the melody,
and the rhythm had a repetitive pattern. However, the model did not seem to obtain the skill of understanding
harmony. In fact, consecutive notes in the generated tunes are almost always adjacent to each other (namely,
the note following C will almost typically be either B or D), and testing on 10 generated tunes, we were not
able to extract any clear chords or arpeggios.
We then asked the model to describe the tune in musical terms. It was able to successfully give a technical
description of the structure in terms of repetitions, the rising or descending parts of the melody and to some
extent the rhythm. However, it seems that the descriptions of the harmony and chords are not consistent
with the notes (in fact, it refers to sequences of adjacent notes, which do not form valid chords, as arpeggios).
We then asked the model to manipulate the melody in two ways. First, we instructed to change a certain
rising sequence to a descending one, which it did successfully. Then we asked the model to convert the tune
to a duet adding a bass voice. The model successfully extends the ABC notation with a second sta which
has compatible rhythm and is played on a lower octave, however there is a lack of harmony between the two
voices.
In summary, the model was able to produce valid tunes in ABC notation and, to some extent, explain and
manipulate their structure. However, we could not get the model to produce any nontrivial form of harmony.
It should be noted that ABC notation is not a very widely used format, and in fact the model was not able
to produce even the most well-known tunes in ABC notation (such as Ode to Joy, F ur Elise or Greensleeves,
all of which are abundant online in that format), nor was it able to recognize these tunes.

20</p><p>3 Coding
In this section, we show that GPT-4 is able to code at a very high level, both in terms of writing code
from instructions and understanding existing code. GPT-4 can handle a wide range of coding tasks, from
coding challenges to real world applications, from low-level assembly to high-level frameworks, from simple
data structures to complex programs such as games. GPT-4 can also reason about code execution, simulate
the eects of instructions, and explain the results in natural language. GPT-4 can even execute pseudocode,
which requires interpreting informal and vague expressions that are not valid in any programming language.
In its current state, we believe that GPT-4 has a high prociency in writing focused programs that only
depend on existing public libraries, which favorably compares to the average software engineer&#x27;s ability . More
importantly, it empowers both engineers and non-skilled users, as it makes it easy to write, edit, and un-
derstand programs. We also acknowledge that GPT-4 is not perfect in coding yet, as it sometimes produces
syntactically invalid or semantically incorrect code, especially for longer or more complex programs. GPT-4
also sometimes fails to understand or follow the instructions, or produces code that does not match the in-
tended functionality or style. With this acknowledgment, we also point out that GPT-4 is able to improve
its code by responding to both human feedback (e.g., by iteratively rening a plot in 3.2) and compiler /
terminal errors (examples in Section 5.1).
Important Disclaimer: As explained in the Introduction (see footnote 1 for example) our experiments
were run on an early version of GPT-4. In particular all quantitative results will be dierent on the nal
version of GPT-4, although the general trends remain the same. We provide numbers here for illustration
purpose only, the denitive benchmark results can be found in OpenAI&#x27;s technical report [Ope23].
3.1 From instructions to code
3.1.1 Coding challenges
A common way to measure coding skill is to pose coding challenges that require implementing a specic
functionality or algorithm. We rst benchmark GPT-4 on HumanEval [CTJ+21], a docstring-to-code dataset
consisting of 164 coding problems that test various aspects of programming logic and prociency. As shown
in Table 1, GPT-4 outperforms other LLMs, including text-davinci-003 (the base model of ChatGPT) and
other models trained specically on code, code-davinci-002 , and CODEGEN-16B [NPH+22].
Model GPT-4 text-davinci-003 Codex(code-davinci-002 ) CODEGEN-16B
Accuracy 82% 65% 39% 30%
Table 1: Zero-shot pass@1 accuracy comparison of dierent models on HumanEval
Although GPT-4&#x27;s accuracy shows a big jump compared to previous models, it could be that GPT-4 has
seen and memorized some (or all) of HumanEval during pre-training. To account for this possibility, we also
evaluate it on LeetCode ( https://leetcode.com ), a popular platform for software engineering interviews,
where new problems are constantly posted and updated. We used LeetCode in Figure 1.5 in the introduction,
where GPT-4 passes all stages of mock interviews for major tech companies. Here, to test on fresh questions,
we construct a benchmark of 100 LeetCode problems posted after October 8th, 2022, which is after GPT-4&#x27;s
pretraining period. As seen in the example in Figure 3.1, we paste the problem instructions into a prompt,
ask GPT-4 to write a python function, and use the ocial LeetCode online judge to check for correctness. We
present the results in Table 2, where we compare GPT-4 to other models and to human performance based
on LeetCode contest results (users who fail all questions are not included, and thus this is a strong sample
of humans). We report both pass@1 and pass@5 accuracies, which measure whether the model produces a
correct solution in the rst or in the rst ve attempts, respectively. GPT-4 signicantly outperforms the
other models, and is comparable to human performance (which we measure in Appendix C.1).

21</p><p>GPT-4
Prompt:
You are given a **0-indexed** m x n integer matrix grid and an integer k. You are currently at position (0, 0) and you want to
reach position (m - 1, n - 1) moving only **down** or **right**.
Return *the number of paths where the sum of the elements on the path is divisible by* k. Since the answer may be very large, return it
**modulo** 10**9 + 7.
**Example 1:**
Input: grid = [[5,2,4],[3,0,5],[0,7,2]], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two paths where the sum of the elements on the path is divisible by k. The first path highlighted in red has a
sum of 5 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 18 which is divisible by 3. The second path highlighted in blue has a sum of 5 + 3 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 15 which
is divisible by 3.
**Example 2:**
Input: grid = [[0,0]], k = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: The path highlighted in red has a sum of 0 + 0 = 0 which is divisible by 5.
**Constraints:**
- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 5 * 10**4
- 1 &lt;= m * n &lt;= 5 * 10**4
- 0 &lt;= grid[i][j] &lt;= 100
- 1 &lt;= k &lt;= 50
**Hints:**
- The actual numbers in grid do not matter. What matters are the remainders you get when you divide the numbers by k.
- We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. What can we use as states?
- Let dp[i][j][value] represent the number of paths where the sum of the elements on the path has a remainder of value when divided by k.
GPT-4:
class Solution(object):
def numberOfPaths(self, grid, k):
&quot;&quot;&quot;
:type grid: List[List[int]]
:type k: int
:rtype: int
&quot;&quot;&quot;
# Define MOD as 10**9 + 7
MOD = 10**9 + 7
# Get the dimensions of the grid
m = len(grid)
n = len(grid[0])
# Initialize a 3D dp array with all zeros
# dp[i][j][value] represents the number of paths where the sum of the elements on the path has a remainder of value when divided
by k
dp = [[[0] * k for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
# Base case: the first cell has only one path and its value is grid[0][0] % k
dp[0][0][grid[0][0] % k] = 1
# Loop through the grid
for i in range(m):
for j in range(n):
# Skip the first cell
if i == 0 and j == 0:
continue
# Loop through all possible remainders
for value in range(k):
# The number of paths to the current cell with the current remainder is equal to the sum of:
# - The number of paths to the top cell with the previous remainder
# - The number of paths to the left cell with the previous remainder
# The previous remainder is equal to the current remainder minus the current value, plus k if it is negative
prev = (value - grid[i][j]) % k
if i &gt; 0:
dp[i][j][value] += dp[i - 1][j][prev]
if j &gt; 0:
dp[i][j][value] += dp[i][j - 1][prev]
# Take the modulo to avoid overflow
dp[i][j][value] %= MOD
# Return the number of paths to the bottom right cell with a remainder of 0
return dp[m - 1][n - 1][0]

better readability thanks to comprehensive commenting.
3.1.2 Real world scenarios
Coding challenges can evaluate the skills in algorithms and data structures. However, they often fail to capture
the full complexity and diversity of real-world coding tasks, which requires specialized domain knowledge,
creativity, and integration of multiple components and libraries, as well as the ability to change existing code.
To assess GPT-4&#x27;s ability to code in more realistic settings, we design end-to-end real-world coding challenges
related to data visualization, L ATEX coding, front-end development, and deep learning, each of which requires
dierent specialized skills. For each task, we provide GPT-4 with high-level instructions, ask it to write the
22</p><p>code in the appropriate language and framework. In a few cases, we also change the specication after the
code is written and ask for an update.
Data Visualization In Figure 3.2, we ask both GPT-4 and ChatGPT to extract data from the L ATEX
code for Table 2 and produce a plot in Python based on a conversation with the user. Afterwards, we ask both
models to perform various operations on the produced plots. While both models extract the data correctly
(not a trivial task, since one must infer from the multicolumn that the Human row has the same value for
k= 1 and k= 5), ChatGPT never produces the desired plot. In contrast, GPT-4 responds appropriately to all
user requests, manipulating the data into the right format and adapting the visualization. In Appendix C.2,
we include another example where GPT-4 visualizes the IMDb dataset.
GPT-4
Prompt:
[in an interactive manner]
I will show you a LaTeX table,
and we will come up with a way to
visualize it better in a question
and answer format The table is
showing the performance of different
language models (and human users)
in generating solutions to code
challenges. Pass@1 means the first
generation works, while Pass@5 means
one out of 5 generation works...
Can you make both plots have the same
range in the y axis? And the legend
has each model name twice.
Is there a way to make the `Human&#x27;
bar more distinctive, to separate it
from the other 3?
Figure 3.2: GPT-4 visualizes data from a L ATEX table (i.e., Table 2). We point out that GPT-4 also
generates the format for this gure. We asked the model how to plot arrows connecting gures in
LATEX and GPT-4 produced a working Tikz snippet with the layout and arrows that we adopt here.
23</p><p>Front-end / Game development In Figure 3.3, we ask GPT-4 to write a 3D game in HTML with
JavaScript, using a very high-level specication. GPT-4 produces a working game in zero-shot fashion that
meets all the requirements. In the 3D game, GPT-4 is even able to interpret the meaning of \defender avatar
is trying to block the enemy&quot;: the defender code has logic so that it positions itself between the player and
enemy. In contrast, ChatGPT responds with \I am an AI language model, I can provide you guidance on
how to create a 3D game in HTML with JavaScript, but I am unable to write code or create a game myself.
Creating a 3D game in HTML with JavaScript requires a lot of programming knowledge and experience. It
is not a task that can be completed quickly or easily. It would take a signicant amount of time and eort
to develop all the necessary features, such as 3D graphics, physics, user input, and AI...&quot;. We give more
examples for front-end (graphical user interface) and game development in Appendix C.
GPT-4
Prompt:
Can you write a 3D game in HTML with Javascript, I want:
-There are three avatars, each is a sphere.
-The player controls its avatar using arrow keys to move.
-The enemy avatar is trying to catch the player.
-The defender avatar is trying to block the enemy.
-There are also random obstacles as cubes spawned randomly at the beginning and moving randomly. The avatars cannot cross those cubes.
-The player moves on a 2D plane surrounded by walls that he cannot cross. The wall should cover the boundary of the entire plane.
-Add physics to the environment using cannon.
-If the enemy catches the player, the game is over.
-Plot the trajectories of all the three avatars.
Episode 1: the player avatar (blue) stands still. The enemy (red) rushes straight towards the player, while the defender
(magenta) attempts to `body block&#x27; the enemy (see its curved trajectory in magenta).
Episode 2: the player (blue) wanders around. The enemy (red) attempts to close the gap but crashes into a cube and
bounces into the air. Trying to obstruct, the defender (magenta) mimics its move to follow up into the air, but ends up
failing. The enemy (red) catches the player (blue) in the end.
Figure 3.3: GPT-4 develops a complex 3D HTML game in JavaScript.
24</p><p>Deep Learning. Writing code for deep learning requires knowledge of mathematics, statistics, and fa-
miliarity with frameworks and libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, etc. In Figure 3.4 we ask both
GPT-4 and ChatGPT to write a custom optimizer module, a task that can be challenging and error-prone
even for human deep learning experts. We give these models a natural language description, which includes
a sequence of non-trivial operations such as applying SVD, truncating a matrix spectrally at the top-k and
top-2k eigenvalues, normalizing the top-k truncated matrix using the F-norm of the top-2k truncated matrix,
applying momentum and weight decay. These instructions are not spelled out in complete detail, e.g., \ap-
ply momentum on Gk&quot; requires \deep learning common sense&quot;. It is important to note that this particular
optimizer does not exist in the literature or on the internet, and thus the models cannot have it memorized,
and must instead compose the concepts correctly in order to produce the code.
GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt:
I want to write a customized optimizer in pytorch, the optimizer should do:
1. the parameters for the optimizer is learning rate, momentum ,weigth decay, d_dim, k and factor alpha
2. the optimizer goes through each parameter in the network, and then
-- Get the gradient of this parameter, reshape it to 2D by looping through the dimensions, and keeping the dimension whose actual
dimension (shape) is equal to d_dim, do an SVD decomposition of the parameter so W = U\Sigma V.
-- Keep the top k singular vectors of W, so we get a new matrix W_k = U \Sigma_k V.
-- Keep the top 2k singular vectors of W, so we get a new matrix W_{2k} = U \Sigma_{2k} V.
-- Normalize W_k according to the momentum of the F-norm of W_{2k}.
-- Truncate each coordinate of W_k to the top alpha percentile of all the coordinates, in absolute value.
-- Apply momentum on W_k, and then update the network parameters using this momentum.
-- Apply weight decay.

Figure 3.4: GPT-4 vs ChatGPT at implementing a customized Pytorch optimizer module. We
highlight the astuteness of GPT-4 vs the mistake by ChatGPT at `applying momentum&#x27;.
While both models produce syntactically valid code, only GPT-4&#x27;s code is semantically correct and matches
the instructions. In contrast, ChatGPT makes a mistake at applying momentum (highlighted in red), a non-
trivial task that requires storing and reading a moving average into and from a separate state buer.
Interfacing with L ATEX. Writing in L ATEX is an important exercise for computer scientists and mathe-
maticians but has a non-trivial learning curve. Even experts make irritating errors that take hours to x on
a daily basis due to its strict grammar and the lack of a good debugger. We show that GPT-4 can utilize
25</p><p>its master-level L ATEX coding skill to greatly simplify the process, with the potential of serving as a new
generation of L ATEX compilers that can handle imprecise natural language descriptions. In Figure 3.5, we ask
GPT-4 to transfer a snippet of written in a semi-rigorous (buggy) L ATEX code mixed with natural language
into accurate L ATEX commands that compiles and is faithful in one shot. In constrast, ChatGPT generates a
snippet that does not compile due to mistakes at using `#&#x27; and ` ncolor&#x27; etc.

3.2 Understanding existing code
The previous examples have shown that GPT-4 can write code from instructions, even when the instructions
are vague, incomplete, or require domain knowledge. They also showed that GPT-4 could respond to follow-
up requests, modifying its own code according to instructions. However, another important aspect of coding
is the ability to understand and reason about existing code, written by others, which might be complex,
obscure, or poorly documented. To test this we pose various questions that require reading, interpreting, or
executing code written in dierent languages and paradigms.
Reverse-engineering assembly code. Reverse engineering is an essential test for software security
which amounts to search for useful information in a executable program written in a machine-readable (i.e.,
binary) representation of CPU instructions. It is a challenging task that requires understanding the syntax,
semantics, and conventions of assembly language, as well as the architecture and behavior of the processor
and the operating system.
We task GPT-4 with performing penetration testing on a binary executable le (code was written in C)
that requires a password to run. We do this via a chat format, where GPT-4 tells the user which commands
to run, and the user responds with the results. We also show in Section 5.1 that GPT-4 is able to run a shell
independently, but this chat mode also provided the benet of it explaining every step. GPT-4 checks the
le format and metadata, disassembles the code with tools like \objdump&quot; and \radare2&quot;, debugs the code
26</p><p>with \gdb&quot; and \ltrace&quot;, and reverse engineers it with techniques like patching, hooking, and decompiling.
During this process, GPT-4 gures out that from the assembly code that the password is compared to a hash
value derived from a simple mathematical formula. GPT-4 then writes a python program that tries dierent
combinations of numbers until it nds one that matches the hash value, cracking the password (an abbreviated
log is presented in Appendix C.6). ChatGPT refuses to do it on the grounds of it being illegal and unethical,
even though reverse engineering is a common practice to ensure software security. Moreover, GPT-4 exhibits
all-around prociency in utilizing existing tools also beyond programming, which we will discuss in details in
Section 5.1.
Reasoning about code execution. In the example in Figure 3.6, we ask GPT-4 and ChatGPT to
predict and explain the output of a C program that prints the size of two structures. GPT-4 correctly explains
that the output may vary depending on the alignment rule used by the compiler, and gives an example of a
possible output with 4-byte alignment. ChatGPT ignores the alignment issue and gives a wrong output, and
also makes a false statement about the order of the members not aecting the size of the structure.
GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt:
struct mystruct_A { char a; int b; char c; } x;
struct mystruct_B { int b; char a; char c; } y;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void) {
printf(&quot;Size of x: %zu bytes\n&quot;, sizeof(x));
printf(&quot;Size of y: %zu bytes\n&quot;, sizeof(y));
return 0;
}
Possible Output:
GPT-4:
There are different ways to implement and align structures in memory,
so the exact output may vary depending on the compiler, platform, and
options used. However, one possible output is:
Size of x: 12 bytes
Size of y: 8 bytes
This output assumes that the compiler uses 4-byte alignment for
structures, meaning that each structure member starts at an
offset that is a multiple of 4 bytes from the beginning of the
structure. This may result in some padding bytes being inserted
between or after the members to maintain alignment. For example,
in x, there may be 3 padding bytes after a and 3 padding bytes after c,
while in y, there may be no padding at all. The size of a structure is
the sum of the sizes of its members plus any padding bytes.ChatGPT:
Size of x: 8 bytes
Size of y: 8 bytes
The output of this code would be the size of the two
structures in bytes. The size of a structure in C is the
sum of the sizes of all of its members. In this case, the size
of mystruct A is the size of a char plus the size of an int
plus the size of another char, which is 1 + 4 + 1 = 8 bytes.
Similarly, the size of mystruct B is also 8 bytes. This
means that both structures will be allocated the same amount
of memory.
Note that the order in which the members are
declared in the structure does not affect its size.

comments are labeled in gold and ChatGPT&#x27;s Mistakes are labeled in red.
Executing Python code The ultimate test of understanding the existing code is to ask the model to
directly execute it. In Figure 3.7, we see that GPT-4 is able to execute non-trivial Python code. It has to
keep track of several variables (including a nested loop and a dictionary) and deal with recursion. It explains
the execution in detail by writing intermediate steps and comments. It is important to note that GPT-4
is not running the code on a Python interpreter, but rather simulating the code in natural language. This
requires a high level of understanding and reasoning about the code, as well as the ability to communicate
the results clearly. In contrast, ChatGPT states (incorrectly) that \The result of DP(3, 4) is not specied in
the given code&quot;, and later on that \It is not clear from the code what the expected output of the function
is, as the specic problem that the function is solving is not provided.&quot; ChatGPT does not simulate the full
execution, but states which functions will be called.

Prompt: I have the following python code:
def to_str(i, j):
return str(i) + &quot;,&quot; + str(j)
dict = {}
def DP(i, j):
if i &lt;= 0 or j &lt;= 0:

dict[to_str(i, j)] = max(arr)
return dict[to_str(i, j)]
What is the result of DP(3, 4)? Write down the execution with intermediate steps.GPT-4:
DP(3, 4):
- i &gt; 0 and j &gt; 0, so we dont return from the first if statement
- to_str(3, 4) is not in dict, so we enter the second if statement
- arr = []
- We loop through ir from 0 to 2, and jr from 0 to 3
- to_str(0, 0) is not in dict, so DP(0, 0) returns abs(4 * 0 - 3 * 0) = 0, dict = {&quot;0,0&quot;: 0}, arr = [0]
- to_str(0, 1) is not in dict, so DP(0, 1) returns abs(4 * 1 - 3 * 0) = 4, dict = {&quot;0,0&quot;: 0, &quot;0,1&quot;: 4}, arr = [0, 4]
- to_str(0, 2) is not in dict, so DP(0, 2) returns abs(4 * 2 - 3 * 0) = 8, dict = {&quot;0,0&quot;: 0, &quot;0,1&quot;: 4, &quot;0,2&quot;: 8}, arr = [0, 4, 8]

arr = [0, 4, 8, 12, 3]
- to_str(1, 1) is not in dict, so DP(1, 1) enters the second if statement, arr1 = []
- We loop through ir from 0 to 0, and jr from 0 to 0
- to_str(0, 0) is in dict, so DP(0, 0) returns 0, arr1 = [0]
- dict[&quot;1,1&quot;] = max(arr1) = 0, dict = {&quot;0,0&quot;: 0, &quot;0,1&quot;: 4, &quot;0,2&quot;: 8, &quot;0,3&quot;: 12, &quot;1,0&quot;: 3, &quot;1,1&quot;: 0}, arr = [0, 4, 8, 12, 3, 0]
- Continuing with the outer loop, to_str(1, 2) is not in dict, so DP(1, 2) enters the second if statement, arr2 = []
- We loop through ir from 0 to 0, and jr from 0 to 1
- to_str(0, 0) is in dict, so DP(0, 0) returns 0, arr2 = [0]
- to_str(0, 1) is in dict, so DP(0, 1) returns 4, arr2 = [0, 4]
... (we skip some steps generated by the model here due to space constraints)
- Continuing with the outer loop, to_str(2, 3) is not in dict, so DP(2, 3) enters the second if statement, arr6 = []
- We loop through ir from 0 to 1, and jr from 0 to 2
- to_str(0, 0) is in dict, so DP(0, 0) returns 0, arr6 = [0]
- to_str(0, 1) is in dict, so DP(0, 1) returns 4, arr6 = [0, 4]
- to_str(0, 2) is in dict, so DP(0, 2) returns 8, arr6 = [0, 4, 8]
- to_str(1, 0) is in dict, so DP(1, 0) returns 3, arr6 = [0, 4, 8, 3]
- to_str(1, 1) is in dict, so DP(1, 1) returns 0, arr6 = [0, 4, 8, 3, 0]

- dict[&quot;3,4&quot;] = max(arr) = 12
- DP(3, 4) returns 12
ChatGPT:
The result of DP(3, 4) is not specified in the given code. The function DP(i, j) is a dynamic programming function that uses a dictionary
to store the result of previously computed values. The function first checks if the input values i and j are less than or equal to 0,
if so it assigns the value of abs(4 * j - 3 * i) to the key to str(i, j) in the dictionary. If the key to str(i, j) does not exist in the
dictionary, the function creates an empty array called arr and then uses nested for loops to append the result of DP(ir, jr) to the array
for all possible values of ir and jr, where ir ranges from 0 to i and jr ranges from 0 to j. Finally, the function assigns the maximum
value of arr to the key to str(i, j) in the dictionary and returns that value.
...
Finally, the function assigns the maximum value of arr to the key to str(3, 4) in the dictionary and returns that value.It is not clear from
the code what the expected output of the function is, as the specific problem that the function is solving is not provided. Additionally,
the function uses nested for loops and recursion that can be computationally expensive and may cause the function to run into an infinite
loop if the base case is not well defined.
Figure 3.7: GPT-4 executes Python code.
Executing pseudo-code. Compiling and executing code written in programming languages is easy, but
that also demands strict adherence to syntax and semantics. Compilers cannot handle vague or informal
expressions, or natural language descriptions of functionality. In contrast, we ask GPT-4 to execute non-
trivial pseudocode in Figure 3.8, noting that it is able to execute and explain every step (including recursion).
ChatGPT is not able to execute, even though it seems able to interpret each line of the code.
In the example below, GPT-4 correctly interprets the informal description of the mergearray function,
which merges two arrays into one array with missing elements. It also understands the recursive function rec
that is dened in a sketchy way. Remarkably, GPT-4 executes the code directly, without translating it into
other well-dened programming languages. This demonstrates the potential of AGI models as a novel tool
for programming with natural language, which could revolutionize the way we code in the future.
28</p><p>GPT-4
Prompt:
I have a python function merge_array, the function takes two arrays of length m, n respectively, and
output a new array by merging the first m-1 element of the first array and the last n - 1 elements of
the second array.
Suppose I call the merge_array function in the following way:
function rec
input: one array A, integer k
code:
if the length of A is less than k, we first call rec(A + [length(A)], k) to get B
after that, call merge_array(B, B) to get C
return C.
if the length of A is larger or equal to k, return A.
end rec
Can you tell me what is the execution of rec([5, 10, 88], 6) with intermediate steps?
GPT-4:
One possible execution of rec([5, 10, 88], 6) with intermediate steps is:
- Since the length of A is 3, which is less than k = 6, we first call rec(A + [length(A)], k) to get B.
That is, we call rec([5, 10, 88, 3], 6).
- In the recursive call, the length of A is 4, which is still less than k = 6, so we again call rec(A +
[length(A)], k) to get B. That is, we call rec([5, 10, 88, 3, 4], 6).
- In the second recursive call, the length of A is 5, which is still less than k = 6, so we again call
rec(A + [length(A)], k) to get B. That is, we call rec([5, 10, 88, 3, 4, 5], 6).
- In the third recursive call, the length of A is 6, which is equal to k = 6, so we return A as B. That
is, we return [5, 10, 88, 3, 4, 5] as B.
- In the second recursive call, we have B = [5, 10, 88, 3, 4, 5], so we call merge_array(B, B) to get C.
The merge_array function takes the first m - 1 = 5 elements of the first array and the last n - 1 = 5
elements of the second array and merges them into a new array. That is, C = [5, 10, 88, 3, 4, 10, 88, 3,
4, 5]. We return C as B.
- In the first recursive call, we have B = [5, 10, 88, 3, 4, 10, 88, 3, 4, 5], so we call merge_array(B,
B) to get C. The merge_array function takes the first m - 1 = 9 elements of the first array and the last
n - 1 = 9 elements of the second array and merges them into a new array. That is, C = [5, 10, 88, 3, 4,
10, 88, 3, 4, 10, 88, 3, 4, 10, 88, 3, 4, 5]. We return C as B.
- In the original call, we have B = [5, 10, 88, 3, 4, 10, 88, 3, 4, 10, 88, 3, 4, 10, 88, 3, 4, 5], so
we return B as the final output of rec([5, 10, 88], 6).
Figure 3.8: GPT-4 executes pseudo-code.
To obtain another preliminary evaluation on how well GPT-4 can maintain the states of the code, in the
Appendix C.7, we run the iconic pseudo code forlarge numbers multiplication in azero shot manner on GPT-4
with hundreds of randomly sampled inputs of multiple lengths. The code demands GPT-4 to update and
remember the state of the array for a large number of steps. We observe that GPT-4, despite being trained
as a (non-exact) natural language model, can nearly correctly preserve the states of the code with more than
50 updates.
29</p><p>4 Mathematical abilities
In this section we begin to assess how well GPT-4 can express mathematical concepts, solve mathematical
problems and apply quantitative reasoning when facing problems that require mathematical thinking and
model-building. We demonstrate that GPT-4 represents a jump in that arena too with respect to previous
LLMs, even when compared to specially ne-tuned for math models such a Minerva. As it seems, how-
ever, GPT-4 is still quite far from the level of experts, and does not have the capacity required to conduct
mathematical research.
The reader is called into caution that interpreting the results in this section correctly is a dicult exercise.
As we will see, GPT-4 can answer dicult (indeed, competitive) high-school level math questions, and can
sometimes engage in meaningful conversation around advanced math topics. Yet, it can also make very basic
mistakes and occasionally produce incoherent output which may be interpreted as a lack of true understanding .
Its mathematical knowledge and abilities can depend on the context in a seemingly arbitrary way.
While it is tempting to evaluate GPT-4&#x27;s mathematical abilities using the same criteria used to assess
human abilities (e.g., solving standard examination questions), in light of the above, this will not provide a
complete picture of the model&#x27;s abilities. In order to really understand the model&#x27;s capabilities, we will need
to break down \mathematical abilities&quot; into various sub-components and evaluate GPT-4&#x27;s performance in
each area. Throughout this section, we will use specic examples and discussions to illustrate the model&#x27;s
strengths and weaknesses, and attempt to pinpoint the possible underlying reasons for these discrepancies.
To give the reader a rst impression regarding GPT-4&#x27;s performance in mathematical problem solving,
consider the example in Figure 4.14.
GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt: Within the duration of one year, a rabbit population rst multiplies itself by a factor aand on the last
day of the year brabbits are taken by humans for adoption. Supposing that on rst day of the rst year there are x
rabbits, we know that exactly 3 years afterwards there will be a population of 27 x 26 rabbits. What are the values of
aandb?
GPT-4:
Let&#x27;s call the rabbit population after one year y. We know that y=ax b. After
two years, the population will be ay b=a(ax b) b=a2x ab b. After three
years, the population will be a(a2x ab b) b=a3x a2b ab b. We are given
that this is equal to 27 x 26, so we have the equation:
a3x a2b ab b= 27x 26
We can rewrite this equation as:
a3x 27x=a2b+ab+b 26
Now we can factor out an xon the left side and a bon the right side:
x(a3 27) =b(a2+a+ 1 26=b)
We can see that a= 3 is a solution for the left side of the equation, so we can
substitute that in:
x(0) =b(9 + 3 + 1 26=b)
This simplies to:
0 = 13b 26
Solving for b, we nd that b= 2. Soa= 3 andb= 2 are the values we are looking
for.ChatGPT:
Letnbe the total number of rab-
bits at the end of the rst year.
Then,
n=ax
At the end of the third year, there
will be 27x 26 rabbits. There-
fore,
(ax b)(a2x b)(a3x b) = 27x 26
Expanding the left side of the
equation, we get
a6x3 (a3+a2+a+ 1)bx2
+(a2+a+ 1)b2x b3
= 27x 26

any of the above steps, producing a nonsensical argument which results in an incorrect answer.
4.1 A mathematical conversation with GPT-4
We now try to further probe the model&#x27;s understanding by posing several follow-up questions to this problem
in the form of a discussion. This discussion will highlight some of the model&#x27;s limitations as well as some key
dierences with humans.
GPT-4
Human: Note that the above question can be alternatively formulated as a question about a function which
is composed with itself three times. Can you provide an alternative formulation of the question?
AI:Yes.Wecouldsaythatwearelookingforvaluesofaandbsuchthatiff(x) =ax b,then
f(f(f(x))) = 27x 26.
GPT-4 grasped the crux of the question and provides a sound mathematical reformulation of the question.
Next, we consider a generalization of the same question.
4.1.1 A rst generalization of the original question
GPT-4
Human:Let&#x27;s now think of a modification of the question you formulated, where instead of f(f(f(x)))
we have the function fcomposed with itself ktimes. For which values of kwill such a linear function
exist?

The model picks the correct heuristics of using an induction , however, it seems that the model is missing
the point of the question (in the modied question, the values of canddare prescribed, so the quantier is
incorrect). We try to point that out.
GPT-4
Human:I don&#x27;t exactly follow. Note that the only modification to the question is that instead of
f(f(f(x))) = 27x 26, we now require that fk(x) = 27x 26. Does your answer address this question?

Human:In your previous answer, however, the quantifier on c;dwas &quot;for some constants candd&quot;. Do you

5At one point, the model assumes that the two sides of the equation need to be zero, which relies on an implicit assumption
that the equation must have a solution. This turns out to be correct, but the reasoning is inaccurate.
31</p><p>The last answer is not accurate (the word \only&quot; is out of place), but GPT-4 does seem to understand
what the problem is.
GPT-4
Human:Well, the question indicated a specific choice of candd. Can you correct your solution then?
AI:Sure.Icancorrectmysolutionasfollows:Foranyvalueofk,therewillbealinearfunc

equalto27x 26,weneedtochoosea= 1andb= 0.
At this point, GPT-4 does not seem to follow its own reasoning. As a result, the induction argument is
invalid, as explained below.
GPT-4
Human:Let me stop you here. You seem to be assuming that fk(x) = 27x 26which fixes the values of a
andb, so how can you now choose new values for aandb?
AI:Iseeyourpoint.Iwastryingtofindafunctionf(x) =ax bthatworksforanyk,butIshould

•Comparethecoefficientsofxandtheconstanttermsonbothsidesoff2(x) =f(27x 26)
The model repeats the same conceptual mistake as above (once again, even though the choice of aandb
has been xed, they are treated as variables whose value may still be chosen). Uninterrupted, it goes on with
the argument without getting anywhere.
Several attempts to continue this dialog all ended up in a dead-end as GPT-4 eectively keeps trying
dierent variations on the same (invalid) induction argument. On the other hand, dierent (but equivalent)
formulations of the original question in an earlier part of the discussion6, occasionally lead to a correct line
of reasoning (depending on the exact wording).
4.1.2 A second variant of the original question
Next, we try to modify the original question in another direction, asking about the case of higher degree
polynomials.
GPT-4
Human:Now suppose that I changed the question so that the function fis a polynomial of degree 2
(where the coefficient of x2is non-zero). Would you be able to find such a function in this case? How
will this change things?
AI:Iffisapolynomialofdegree 2,thenwecanwritef(x) =ax2+bx+cforsomeconstantsa;b;c.
Then,thegivenequationbecomes...
6For example, if to the follow-up question, we add the words &quot;Note that the right hand side remains the linear function 27 x 26
32</p><p>At this point, GPT-4 outputs a very long calculation, makes several mistakes and does not arrive at
the correct answer (being that there is no solution in this case). Instead, we interrupt it and advice the
higher-degree kmore abstractly.
GPT-4
Human:Hold on- before you try to explicitly write this calculation, perhaps there is something you can
deduce here without carrying out any calculations?
AI:Well,onethingIcannoticeisthatiffisapolynomialofdegree 2,thenf(f(f(x)))isapolyno

degree 1forallvaluesofx.Therefore,thereisnopolynomialofdegree 2thatsatisfiestheequation
f(f(f(x))) = 27x+ 13.
This is a solid argument. We now follow up with another question:
GPT-4
Human:Right. So, linear functions are nice because if you compose a linear function with itself you
still get a linear function. What other classes of functions with that property are there?
AI:Someotherclasses offunctionsthathavethispropertyareexponentialfunctions,logarithmicfunc
tions,andpowerfunctions.Forexample,iff(x) =ex,thenf(f(x)) =eex,whichisstillanexponential

Andiff(x) =xkforsomeconstantk,thenf(f(x)) = (xk)k=xk2,whichisstillapowerfunction.These
functionsarecallediteratedfunctions,andtheyhavesomeinterestingpropertiesandapplicationsin
mathematics.
This is a mistake of course, as the classes of exponential and logarithmic functions do not have the desired
property (they are not closed under composition). Next, we check if GPT-4 is able to realize and correct its
mistake.
GPT-4
Human:Are you sure eexis an exponential function?
AI:Well,itdependsonhowyoudefineanexponentialfunction.Somesources defineanexponentialfunc

This discussion seems to again have driven GPT-4 to a dead-end, and it begins contradicting itself and
produces increasingly incoherent arguments as the conversation continues.
33</p><p>Takeaways: One might speculate at this point that GPT-4 simply lacks the relevant knowledge regarding
the behavior of exponential functions. However, this does not seem to be the case, as the model can correctly
answer and justify the question \Is it true that abc= (ab)c?&quot;. This suggests that, as in other domains, GPT-
4&#x27;s mathematical knowledge is context-dependent . While this does not mean that GPT-4 only memorizes
commonly used mathematical sentences and performs a simple pattern matching to decide which one to use
(for example, alternating names/numbers, etc. typically does not aect GPT-4&#x27;s answer quality), we do see
that changes in the wording of the question can alter the knowledge that the model displays.
4.1.3 Analysis of the limitations highlighted by conversation
The above dialogue highlights a striking contrast between the model&#x27;s performance on tasks and questions that
require a signicant level of mathematical sophistication on one hand, and its basic mathematical errors and
invalid statements on the other. If a human were to produce the latter, we would doubt their understanding.
Arguably, this contrast is very atypical to humans. Therefore, we face a challenging question:
To what extent does the model demonstrate \true understanding&quot; in mathematics?
This question is not well-dened. Nonetheless, we make an attempt to answer it. We rst want to argue that
mathematical understanding has several aspects:
1.Creative reasoning: The ability to identify which arguments, intermediate steps, calculations or
algebraic manipulations are likely to be relevant at each stage, in order to chart a path towards the
solution. This component is often based on a heuristic guess (or in the case of humans, intuition), and
is often considered to be the most substantial and profound aspect of mathematical problem-solving.
2.Technical prociency: The ability to perform routine calculations or manipulations that follow a
prescribed set of steps (such as dierentiating a function or isolating a term in an equation).
3.Critical reasoning: The ability to critically examine each step of the argument, break it down into
its sub-components, explain what it entails, how it is related to the rest of the argument and why it is
correct. When solving a problem or producing a mathematical argument, this usually comes together
with the ability to backtrack when a certain step is realized to be incorrect and modify the argument
accordingly.
We now want to analyze the model&#x27;s performance in each of these aspects of mathematical understanding,
and discuss some possible reasons for its strengths and weaknesses.
Creative reasoning. When it comes to advanced high-school level problems (and occasionally higher
level), the model demonstrates a high level of ability in choosing the right argument or path towards the
solution. To relate this to the example above, the model correctly chooses to try and write recurrence
relations in the original question, and to argue about the degrees of compositions of polynomials in the
follow-up question. In both cases, the suggestion is made before \knowing&quot; whether or not this path is going
to lead to the correct solution. Section 4.2 and Appendix D contains more examples demonstrating the
model&#x27;s capabilities in this aspect, which we compare to that of a good high-school student or even higher.
Technical prociency. While the model clearly demonstrates a high degree of knowledge of the algo-
rithms related to dierent procedures (such as solving a system of equations), it also makes very frequent
mistakes when performing these tasks, such as making arithmetic mistakes, confusing the order of operations
or using incorrect notation. We further discuss some examples of these typical errors in Appendix D.1. We
speculate that this aspect could be improved by giving the model access to code execution, which would
allow it to perform calculations or check equivalences more accurately; some evidence for this is provided in
Appendix D.
Critical reasoning. The model exhibits a signicant deciency in the third aspect, namely critically
examining each step of the argument. This could be attributed to two factors. First, the training data of the
model mainly consists of questions and their solutions, but it does not capture the wording that expresses
thethinking process which leads to the solution of a math problem, in which one makes guesses, encounters
errors, veries and examines which parts of the solution are correct, backtracks, etc. In other words, since the
training data is essentially a linear exposition of the solution, a model trained on this data has no incentive to
engage in an \inner dialogue&quot; where it revisits and critically evaluates its own suggestions and calculations.
34</p><p>Second, the limitation to try things and backtrack is inherent to the next-word-prediction paradigm that the
model operates on. It only generates the next word, and it has no mechanism to revise or modify its previous
output, which makes it produce arguments \linearly&quot;.
Loosely speaking, we can therefore see the drawbacks of the model as a combination of \naive&quot; attention
mistakes with more fundamental limitations due to its \linear thinking&quot; as a next-token prediction machine.
An important question is which of the above issues can be alleviated by further training (perhaps with a
larger model). For the former problem, we believe that further training could alleviate the issue, as evidenced
by the super-human coding abilities where such attention mistakes would also be fatal; a key dierence is
that GPT-4 was most likely trained on much more code than mathematics data. We believe that the latter
issue constitutes a more profound limitation. We discuss it in more detail in Section 8.
In the remainder of the section, we assess the model&#x27;s capabilities on commonly used benchmarks for
mathematical problem solving and demonstrate the model&#x27;s capability of applying quantitative thinking
in real-world scenarios. We also compare the performance of GPT-4 and ChatGPT on both benchmarks
and other mathematical problems (more examples in Appendix D). Roughly speaking, we nd that GPT-4
demonstrates a signicant improvement over ChatGPT: GPT-4 shows a deeper understanding of the problem
and is able to apply the appropriate reasoning in many complicated problems. ChatGPT, on the other hand,
often resorts to low-level heuristics, mentioning formulas and concepts that are only supercially related
to the problem which point to a lack of actual comprehension. We end the section with a few examples
demonstrating the capabilities on higher level mathematics.
4.2 Performance on mathematical problem datasets
We now conduct systematic experiments to compare the performance of GPT-4, ChatGPT and Minerva (state-
of-the-art LLM for solving math questions) on two math data sets which are commonly used as benchmarks:
GSM8K [CKB+21] and MATH [HBK+21]. GSM8K is an elementary school math data set that contains
8,000 questions and answers on topics such as arithmetic, fractions, geometry, and word problems. MATH is
a high school math data set that contains 12,500 questions and answers on topics such as algebra, calculus,
trigonometry, and probability. We also test the model on MMMLU-STEM data set, which contains around
2000 multiple choices (4 choices) questions covering high school and college STEM topics. These data sets
highlight GPT-4&#x27;s ability to use the correct approach to solve high school-level math questions.
Important Disclaimer: As explained in the Introduction (see footnote 1 for example) our experiments
were run on an early version of GPT-4. In particular all quantitative results will be dierent on the nal
version of GPT-4, although the general trends remain the same. We provide numbers here for illustration
purpose only, the denitive benchmark results can be found in OpenAI&#x27;s technical report [Ope23].
Mitigating over-tting. A potential concern for using benchmarks to evaluate the reasoning abilities
of LLMs is that they might have memorized the questions or answers for the benchmark datasets during its
pre-training, as those questions are potentially part of the dataset. To reduce the likelihood of this form of
overtting, we adopt the following strategies:
1. In the benchmarks, we tested GPT-4 by asking it to (1) write a template for the solution of the problem,
(2) write down the steps rst then write down the nal answer. The templates are not available online,
and detailed solutions for datasets such as MMMLU-STEM are also not online (only the answer is).
2. We pick one representative question from the data set where GPT-4 solves correctly and text-davinci-003
solves incorrectly. We alter the numbers in the question and see that GPT-4 is consistently correct and
text-davinci-003 is consistently wrong.
3. We also crafted several new questions, carefully checking that these questions or close variants do not
appear online. It appears that GPT-4 demonstrates the same performance on those questions.

GPT-4 memorization test by alternating the numbers
Prompt: If a degree 3 polynomial satisifies p(x) = 0 for x = -3, 8, 5 and p(1) = 10, what is |p(0)|?
Figure 4.2: One way to test whether GPT-4 memorizes the exact statement of the original problem
is to vary the values of xandp(1) in the input. We randomly select three values of xfrom the
setf 10; 9;; 2g[f 2;3;;10gand one value of p(1) from the set f 10; 9;; 1g[
f1;2;;10g, and use them to construct new inputs. We compare the accuracy of GPT-4 and
text-davinci-003 on these inputs. The results show that GPT-4 achieves an accuracy of 75 :2%,
whiletext-davinci-003 only has an accuracy of 0 :2%. This suggests that GPT-4 does not rely on
memorizing the exact problem statement but on applying a general solution method. While it is
possible that GPT-4 memorizes the solution template, this is not necessarily a aw, as it is also a
common way of solving math problems for humans.
For the benchmark datasets, we evaluated the models on their single model accuracy, which is the per-
centage of questions that they answered correctly in one try. The results are shown in the following table:
Model GSM8K MATH MMMLU-STEM
text-davinci-003 61.3% 23.5% 54.2%
Minerva 58.8% 33.6% 63.9%
GPT-4 87.1% 42.5% 82.7%
Table 3: Accuracy of dierent models on math data sets
GPT-4&#x27;s accuracy shows a modest improvement over other models, but a manual inspection of GPT-4&#x27;s
answers on MATH reveals that GPT-4&#x27;s errors are largely due to arithmetic and calculation mistakes: the
model exhibits large deciency when managing large numbers or complicated expressions. In contrast, in
most cases, the argument produced by ChatGPT is incoherent and leads to a calculation which is irrelevant
to the solution of the problem to begin with. Figure 4.3 gives one example which illustrates this dierence.
We further discuss the issue of calculation errors in Appendix D.1.

Arithmetic mistakes (including counting) 68%
Misunderstanding the problem statement 10%

GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt:
A rain barrel collects water o the roof of a house during three hours of heavy rainfall. The height of the water in
the barrel increases at the rate of r(t) = 4t3e 1:5tfeet per hour, where tis the time in hours since the rain began.
At timet= 1 hour, the height of the water is 0 :75 foot. What is the height of the water in the barrel at time t= 2 hours?
GPT-4:
If we can nd a function Fsuch thatF0(t) =r(t), thenF(2) F(1) is the amount that the height of the water increases
fromt= 1 tot= 2.
To nd such a function F, we can use the technique of integration by parts, which says that if uandvare dierentiable

Z

Applying this to r(t) = 4t3e 1:5t, we can choose u=t3anddv= 4e 1:5tdt, so thatdu= 3t2dtandv= 8

ChatGPT:
To nd the height of the water in the barrel at time t= 2 hours, we need to nd the value of r(2). We can do this by
plugging 2 in for tin the expression for r(t):
r(2) = 4(2)3e 1:5(2)= 32e 3
To nd the height of the water in the barrel at time t= 2 hours, we need to add the amount of water collected during
the rst hour (0 :75 feet) to the amount of waterrorsllected during the second hour ( r(2) feet). So, the total height of
the water in the barrel at time t= 2 hours is:
0:75 +r(2) = 0:75 + 32e 30:91feet
Therefore, the height of the water in the barrel at time t= 2 hours is approximately 0 :91 feet.

4.3 Mathematical modeling in various domains
Mathematical reasoning is more than a skill for solving mathematical exercises and problems; it is also a
tool for understanding and communicating about various contexts and situations. In this section, we assess
GPT-4&#x27;s capacity to use mathematical ideas and techniques to address real-world problems, some of which are
37</p><p>not strictly mathematical, but demand quantitative thinking. We show below how GPT-4 successfully builds
a plausible mathematical model for a complex system that requires extensive interdisciplinary knowledge,
while ChatGPT fails to make meaningful progress.
GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt:
Please come up with mathematical model for profiling the physiological power rate over time of a
professional StarCraft 2 player during a match. Make sure your model accounts for player&#x27;s Actions
per Minute (APM) and the race the player plays. Please keep your answer concise.
GPT-4:
One possible mathematical model for profiling the physiological power rate over time of a professional StarCraft 2 player during a match
is: P(t) = B + A * f(t) * g(r) where: - P(t) is the power rate in watts at time t
- B is the basal metabolic rate in watts, which depends on the player&#x27;s age, weight, height, and gender
- A is a constant factor that represents the additional energy expenditure per unit of APM - f(t) is a function that models the APM over
time, which may depend on the match duration, the game phase, the player&#x27;s strategy, and the opponent&#x27;s actions
- g(r) is a function that models the race modifier, which may depend on the race the player plays, the race the opponent plays, and the
map features Some possible assumptions and simplifications for this model are:
- The power rate is proportional to the APM, which is a common measure of the player&#x27;s speed and intensity of actions
- The APM over time follows a general pattern of increasing in the early game, peaking in the mid game, and decreasing in the late game,
but may vary depending on the specific match conditions
- The race modifier reflects the different characteristics and demands of each race, such as the number and type of units, the amount and
frequency of micro and macro management, and the level of aggression or defense
- The basal metabolic rate and the constant factor A are estimated based on average values for professional StarCraft 2 players
- The model ignores other factors that may affect the power rate, such as the player&#x27;s mood, stress, fatigue, hydration, nutrition, and
external environment An example of how to estimate the parameters and functions for this model is: - B = 80 W, based on the average basal
metabolic rate for a 25-year-old male with a weight of 70 kg and a height of 175 cm
- A = 0.1 W/APM, based on the assumption that each APM requires an additional 0.1 W of energy
- f(t) = 100 + 50 * sin(pi * t / T), based on the assumption that the APM follows a sinusoidal pattern with a minimum of 50 APM, a maximum
of 150 APM, and a period of T minutes, which is the average match duration
- g(r) = 1 + 0.2 * (r - 1), based on the assumption that the race modifier increases by 0.2 for each race in the order of Protoss, Terren
and Zerg, reflecting the increasing complexity and diversity of each race Using this example, the power rate for a Zerg player at 10
minutes into a 20-minute match against a Protoss player would be: P(10) = 80 + 0.1 * (100 + 50 * sin(pi * 10 / 20)) * (1 + 0.2 * (3 - 1))
= 101 W
ChatGPT:
A possible mathematical model to profile the physiological power rate over time of a professional StarCraft 2 player during a match could
be:
Power rate = f(APM, Race, Time)
Where f is a function that maps the player&#x27;s Actions per Minute (APM), race, and time into the player&#x27;s physiological power rate. APM is a
measure of how fast and efficiently the player is making decisions and executing actions in the game. Race is the player&#x27;s chosen species
in the game, which may affect the player&#x27;s APM and power rate. Time is the elapsed time in the match.
This function could be estimated using regression analysis with data from previous matches, physiological monitoring devices, and game
logs. The resulting model could be used to predict the player&#x27;s power rate during future matches and help players and coaches optimize
their performance and training.

StarCraft 2 player during a match.
Fermi questions. A specic type of mathematical modeling problems are Fermi questions. Fermi ques-
tions involve making educated guesses about quantities or phenomena that are dicult or impossible to
measure directly, using logic, approximation, and order-of-magnitude reasoning. For example, some well-
known Fermi questions are: \How many piano tuners are there in Chicago?&quot; and \How many times does
the electric eld of the sun&#x27;s peak color oscillate during its journey to earth?&quot;. To solve these problems with
little or no additional information, it requires both quantitative thinking and general knowledge. Here we
demonstrate GPT-4&#x27;s outstanding ability to answer Fermi questions with quantitative thinking. We show
two examples in Figure 4.5, where GPT-4 attempts at them by making layers of reasonable assumptions and
informed guesses, while ChatGPT admits defeat immediately barely showing trace of mathematical thinking.
Even though GPT-4&#x27;s nal answers are likely to be far o, it demonstrates an impressive angle of attack at
these problems.
38</p><p>GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt:
Please estimate roughly how many Fermi questions are being asked everyday?
GPT-4:
There is no definitive answer to how many Fermi questions are being asked everyday, but one possible way to approach the problem is to
make some assumptions and use some estimates based on available data. Here is one possible example:
- Assume that a Fermi question is a question that requires an order-of-magnitude estimation of some quantity or phenomenon that is not
easily measured or known, such as the number of piano tuners in Chicago, the mass of the Eiffel Tower, or the amount of water in Lake
Michigan.
- Assume that a Fermi question is more likely to be asked by people who are interested in science, math, engineering, or logic, or who are
engaged in some form of education, research, or problem-solving that involves such topics.
- Assume that the population of the world is about 7.8 billion, and that about 25% of them are in the age range of 15 to 64, which is
roughly the working-age population. This gives about 1.95 billion potential Fermi question askers.
- Assume that the average literacy rate among the working-age population is about 86%, and that literacy is a prerequisite for asking or
answering a Fermi question. This gives about 1.68 billion literate potential Fermi question askers.
- Assume that the average interest rate in science, math, engineering, or logic among the literate potential Fermi question askers
is about 10%, and that interest is a proxy for the likelihood of asking or answering a Fermi question. This gives about 168 million
interested potential Fermi question askers.
- Assume that the average frequency of asking or answering a Fermi question among the interested potential Fermi question askers is about
once a month, and that this frequency is independent of the day of the week, the time of the day, or the season of the year. This gives
about 5.6 million Fermi questions asked or answered per day.
Therefore, based on these assumptions and estimates, a rough answer to how many Fermi questions are being asked everyday is about 5.6
million. However, this answer is subject to a lot of uncertainty and variation, depending on the validity and accuracy of the assumptions
and estimates, and the definition and scope of what constitutes a Fermi question.
ChatGPT:
The number of Fermi questions asked daily is difficult to estimate accurately. However, based on the estimated number of daily active
users on websites where such questions are commonly asked (e.g. forums, Q&amp;A sites, etc.), one could make a rough estimate of the number
of Fermi questions being asked daily. For example, if a website has 1 million active users and each user asks 1 Fermi question per day,
then the number of Fermi questions being asked daily on that website would be 1 million. However, this is a rough estimate and the actual
number could be higher or lower.

GPT-4:
There is no definitive answer to how many Nvidia A100s are there in total on earth, but one possible way to approach the question is
to use some available data and assumptions to make a rough estimate. Here are some possible steps and sources: - According to Nvidia&#x27;s
website, the A100 is available in various form factors, such as PCIe cards, SXM4 modules, HGX A100 systems, and cloud instances. Each form
factor may have different numbers of A100 GPUs per unit, ranging from one to 16. For simplicity, we can assume an average of four A100
GPUs per unit across all form factors.
- According to Nvidia&#x27;s Q4 2021 earnings call transcript, the company reported a record revenue of $2.91 billion from its data center
segment, which includes the A100 and other products. Assuming that the A100 accounts for a significant portion of this segment, we can
estimate that the A100 revenue was about $2 billion in Q4 2021.
- According to Nvidia&#x27;s website, the list price of the A100 PCIe card is $11,000, and the list price of the HGX A100 4-GPU system is
$69,000. Assuming that these prices are representative of the average selling price of the A100 across all form factors, we can estimate
that the average selling price of a unit with four A100 GPUs is about $20,000. - Dividing the estimated A100 revenue by the estimated
average selling price, we can estimate that Nvidia sold about 100,000 units with four A100 GPUs each in Q4 2021, or about 400,000 A100
GPUs in total.
- Assuming that Q4 2021 was a typical quarter for A100 sales, and that the A100 was launched in mid-2020, we can estimate that Nvidia sold
about 800,000 units with four A100 GPUs each in 2020 and 2021, or about 3.2 million A100 GPUs in total.
- Adding a margin of error to account for possible variations in prices, sales, form factors, and launch dates, we can estimate that there
are between 2.5 million and 4 million A100 GPUs on earth as of early 2022.
Of course, this estimate is based on many assumptions and uncertainties, and should not be taken as a definitive or authoritative answer.
It is possible that Nvidia has sold more or less A100 GPUs than estimated, or that some A100 GPUs have been decommissioned, damaged, or
lost. Therefore, the actual number of A100 GPUs on earth may be higher or lower than the estimate.
ChatGPT:
It is not possible to determine the exact number of Nvidia A100 GPUs on Earth, as the company does not publicly disclose sales figures.
However, as of 2021, it is estimated that there are hundreds of thousands of Nvidia A100 GPUs in use globally.

4.4 Higher level mathematics
We conclude this section with a few examples that demonstrate the model&#x27;s potential performance on more
advanced mathematical topics. These examples have been intentionally selected to demonstrate the model&#x27;s
capabilities, and it is important to note that the model does not always succeed with questions of this level of
diculty. Instead, they are meant to showcase the extent of the model&#x27;s capabilities, suggesting what future
models might be able to achieve.
39</p><p>We begin with a simplication of a question which appeared in the 2022 International Mathematics
Olympiad (IMO).
GPT-4
Prompt:
Supposegis a continuous smooth function such that for every x &gt; 0, there is one and only one y &gt; 0 such that
g(x) +g(y)2xy. Can you prove that g(x) =x2?
GPT-4:
There are a few possible ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is as follows:
- Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that g(x) is not equal to x2for somex&gt;0.
- Then, either g(x)&lt;x2org(x)&gt;x2for thatx.
- Ifg(x)&lt;x2, then lety=x. Theng(x) +g(y) = 2g(x)&lt;2x2= 2xy.
- Ifg(x) +g(y)&lt;2xy, theng(x) +g(y) is strictly less than the upper bound of 2 xyfor positive xandy.
- This means that there is some room to increase yslightly and still satisfy the inequality g(x) +g(y)2xy.
- For example, let y0=y+, whereis a small positive number such that g(x) +g(y0)&lt;2xy. This is possible because
gis continuous and smooth, so it does not have any jumps or kinks that would prevent such a choice of epsilon.
- Then,y0is another positive number such that g(x) +g(y0)2xy0, which contradicts the assumption that yis the one
and only one positive number that satises this condition given x.
- Therefore, if g(x)&lt;x2, theng(x) +g(y) cannot be strictly less than 2 xy, and it must be equal to 2 xy.
- Ifg(x)&gt;x2, then letybe the unique positive solution of g(x) +g(y) = 2xy. Theng(y)&lt;(y)2, since otherwise we
would have g(x) +g(y)&gt;2xy, which contradicts the existence of ygivenx.
- But then, by the same argument as before, we can let x=y=yand obtain a contradiction, since g(y) +g(y) =
2g(y)&lt;2y2= 2yy, which contradicts the uniqueness of ygiveny.
- Therefore, g(x) must be equal to x2for allx&gt;0, as required.
What distinguishes this question from those that typically appear in undergraduate calculus exams in
STEM subjects is that it does not conform to a structured template. Solving it requires a more creative
approach, as there is no clear strategy for beginning the proof. For example, the decision to split the argu-
ment into two cases ( g(x)&gt; x2andg(x)&lt; x2) is not an obvious one, nor is the choice of y(its reason only
becomes clear later on in the argument). Furthermore, the solution demands knowledge of calculus at the
undergraduate level. Nevertheless, GPT-4 manages to produce a correct proof.
The second example is in the form of a discussion which concerns algorithms and graph theory, topics
typically covered in the rst or second year of an undergraduate computer science degree. The discussion is
comparable to that of a graduate-level interview.

Figure 4.6: A discussion regarding k-SAT problems and graph theory.
GPT-4 demonstrates understanding of the concepts from graph theory and algorithms. It is able to reason
about an abstract graph construction, which relates to a constraint satisfaction problem, and deduce correct
conclusions about the SAT problem (to the best of our knowledge, this construction does not appear in
the mathematical literature). The conversation reects profound understanding of the undergraduate-level
mathematical concepts discussed, as well as a signicant extent of creativity. Although GPT-4 makes a
mistake in one instance (writing 2n 1rather than 2n=2), the subsequent conversation demonstrates that this
error does not reect a lack of understanding. Rather, GPT-4 seems to have made an error in a manner
41</p><p>similar to a human typo, as it later provides the correct generalization of the formula.
Our last example requires the grasp of a new mathematical denition, and combines knowledge in both
number theory and probability. The model produces a sound argument but makes a counting mistake at the
end which leads to an incorrect nal answer.
GPT-4
Prompt:
A good number is a 5-digit number where the 1,3,5-th digits are odd numbers and they form an increasing arithmetic
progression, and the number is divisible by 3. If I randomly sample a good number, what is the probability that its 2nd
digit is 4?
GPT-4:
There are a few ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is to use some modular arithmetic and
enumeration. First, we can observe that a 5-digit number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible
by 3. So, if we let the 5-digit number be abcde , wherea,c, andeare odd digits forming an arithmetic progression, we
have the equation:
a+b+c+d+e= 0 (mod 3)
We can also observe that the dierence between any two consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression is constant, so
we can let that dierence be f, wherefis a positive integer. Then we have:
c=a+f;e=a+ 2f
Substituting these into the equation above, we get:
a+b+a+f+d+a+ 2f= 0 (mod 3)
3a+b+d+ 3f= 0 (mod 3)
Since 3aand 3f are always divisible by 3, we can ignore them and focus on the equation:
b+d= 0 (mod 3)
The choice of a,fandedoes not aect this equation, so we can x them and vary bandd. For example, let a= 1,f
= 2, ande= 5. Then we have the possible values of banddas:
b= 0;d= 0;3;6;9;b= 1;d= 2;5;8;b= 2;d= 1;4;7;b= 3;d= 0;3;6;9;b= 4;d= 2;5;8
b= 5;d= 1;4;7;b= 6;d= 0;3;6;9;b= 7;d= 2;5;8;b= 8;d= 1;4;7;b= 9;d= 0;3;6;9
We can see that there are 10 possible values of b, and for each value of b, there are 4 possible values of d. So, there are
104 = 40 possible pairs of b and d that satisfy the equation. Out of these 40 pairs, only 3 have b= 4, namely (4, 2),
(4, 5), and (4, 8). So, the probability that b= 4 is 3=40.
42</p><p>5 Interaction with the world
One of the key aspects of intelligence is interactivity, which we dene as the ability to communicate and
respond to feedback from other agents, tools, and environments. Interactivity is important for intelligence,
as it enables agents to acquire and apply knowledge, solve problems, adapt to changing situations, and
achieve goals that are beyond their individual capabilities. For example, humans interact with one another
and with environments to collaborate, learn, teach, negotiate, create, etc. Interactivity requires an agent
to comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience, and thus it is closely tied to our
denition of intelligence.
In this section, we explore two dimensions of interactivity: tool use and embodied interaction. Tool use
involves the use of external resources, such as search engines, calculators, or other APIs, to perform tasks
that are dicult or impossible for the agent alone. Embodied interaction involves the use of natural language
as a text interface to interact with simulated or real-world environments, and to receive feedback from them.
5.1 Tool use
Despite impressive performance on various tasks in the previous sections, GPT-4 still suers from various
well-documented weaknesses of language models. These weaknesses include (but are not limited to) lack of
current world knowledge, diculty with symbolic operations (e.g., math), and inability to execute code. For
example, in Figure 5.1, GPT-4 uses out-of-date information to answer the rst question and fails to perform
the appropriate operations for the second and third questions. ChatGPT refuses to answer the rst question,
and also fails on the others.
GPT-4 and ChatGPT: Symbolic manipulation

Figure 5.1: Current knowledge and symbolic manipulation are hard for language models.
However, GPT-4 is able to use external tools such as search engines or APIs to overcome these (and
other) limitations. For example, in Figure 5.2, we show a simple prompt that gives GPT-4 access to a search
engine and other functions. During execution, when one of these functions is called, we pause generation,
call the appropriate function, paste the results back into the prompt, and continue the generation. In these

the question. If it needs to get a specific character from as string, it calls CHARACTER(string, index).

Figure 5.2: Examples of GPT-4 using various tools to answer questions.
simple examples, GPT-4 is able to use the tools with very minimal instruction and no demonstrations, and
then make use of the output appropriately (note how the second search result contains potentially conicting
information, and GPT-4 is still able to infer the right answer). In contrast, ChatGPT (not shown) does
not consistently change its answers to the questions in Figure 5.1 after being instructed to use the tools {
it still refused to answer the rst question; for the other two, it sometimes does not call the tools at all,
and sometimes calls them after giving an incorrect answer. While in Figure 5.2 we specify which tools are
available, GPT-4 can also list which tools (or API functions) are needed in order to solve a task (example in
Appendix, Figure F.2, where GPT-4 lists four API functions needed to complete a task and then proceeds to
use them eectively).
5.1.1 Using multiple tools to solve more complex tasks
Solving more complex tasks requires GPT-4 to use multiple tools in combination. We now share examples
where GPT-4 is able to do this by relying on its ability to understand the task at hand, identify the tools
needed, use them in the correct order, and respond appropriately to their output.
Hacking. In Figure F.3 (Appendix), we tell GPT-4 it can execute commands on a Linux distribution
designed for digital forensics and penetration testing, and task it with hacking into a computer on the local
network. Without any information, it is able to formulate and execute a plan, where it scans the network for
devices, identies a target host, runs an executable that tries common passwords, and gains root access to the
machine. While the machine was easy to hack into, we note that GPT-4 is well-versed in Linux commands,
and is able to run the appropriate commands, interpret their output, and adapt in order to solve its goal.
ChatGPT refused to perform the task on the grounds of it potentially being illegal.

Figure 5.3: GPT-4 plays the role of a Zoo manager to complete tasks in the command prompt.
Managing a zoo through command line instructions. GPT-4 may have seen near-copies of the
previous example in its training data. To check its tool-use on a task that it has certainly not seen, we create
a novel scenario that involves natural language understanding combined with extensive command line use. In
the scenario, we have GPT-4 play the role of a zoo manager, completing a sequence of six tasks specied in a
le (See Figure 5.3, where GPT-4 starts by correctly issuing the command type todo.txt ). To complete the
tasks, GPT-4 has to manipulate les and folders representing dierent animals, areas, and information about
the zoo, requiring it to understand both the task at hand (e.g., Figure out which animals are misplaced in
the \Tropical Rain Forest&quot;) and the appropriate commands.
Despite the breadth of the challenge (more than 100 commands were required to complete all tasks),
GPT-4 was able to solve almost all tasks. Its only failure was fabricating content when replying to emails,
rather than reading the specied content from a le (Appendix F.1.1), a problem xed by a simple tweak
to the prompt (Appendix F.1.2). While GPT-4 often displayed ingenuity (e.g., running breadth-rst search
manually to navigate directories), it often ran incorrect commands, such as deleting a le that had spaces in
its name (e.g., \ Polar Bear.txt &quot;) without adding quotation marks. However, it was able to correct itself
without human intervention given the system response (\Could not nd...&quot;). Interestingly, GPT-4 made the
same mistake in subsequent les with spaces (and always applied the same correction), even though it could
predict what the error message would be given the wrong command. Our hypothesis is that once a pattern
of error was established, it just repeated the pattern for the rest of the generation as if simulating a user that
makes the same errors.
Managing calendar and email. In Figure 5.4, we illustrate how GPT-4 is able to use multiple tools
in combination to manage a user&#x27;s calendar and email. The user requests that GPT-4 coordinate a dinner
with two other people, and book it on a night when the user is free. GPT-4 uses the available APIs to
retrieve information about the user&#x27;s calendar, coordinate with other people over email, book the dinner,
and message the user with the details. In this example, GPT-4 demonstrates its ability to combine multiple
tools and APIs, as well as reason about free-form outputs in order to solve a complex task (e.g., \Tuesday or
Wednesday Night&quot; is combined with \any day from Monday to Thursday&quot; and the fact that the user is busy
on Tuesday, yielding Wednesday as the only viable option). ChatGPT (not shown) was not able to accomplish
the same task, and instead wrote a function where \joe@microsoft.com&quot; emails \luke@microsoft.com&quot; with
a single date, and checks if the response contained the token \yes&quot;. ChatGPT was also not able to respond
when the output of its function was given it.
Browsing the web for information. In Figures 5.5 and 5.6, GPT-4 uses a search engine and a
SUMMARIZE function (which downloads the webpage and calls itself to summarize it given the question
at hand) to browse the web and answer questions. In both cases, GPT-4 is able to identify relevant search
results to look at with more depth, summarize them, and provide accurate answers, even when the question
contains a false premise. While prior versions of LLMs can also be taught to browse the web [NHB+21], we

The computer is answering questions.
If the computer needs any current information to answer the question, it can call one of the following
functions:
- SEARCH(&quot;query&quot;) searches the web, and returns the top snippets
- SUMMARIZE(snippet id) downloads the webpage, and summarizes it
- CALC(expression) computes a mathematical expression

&gt; Search Results
[1] Why are boats white? 5 glowing reasons why boats are mainly white ...
The essential reason why the boat is white is it reflects most of the light by not absorbing much heat
as other colors do, thereby making the boat interior cooler than other colored boats. And some other
reasons are it reduces manufacturing costs &amp; latency, and it&#x27;s easy to spot any damages or rust on the
hull.
[2] Why Are Boats White? - Boating Buddy
The main reason boats are typically white is because it helps to reflect the sun&#x27;s rays and keep the
boat cool. Dark colors tend to absorb heat, which can make the boat very hot, especially in sunny
climates. White is also a good color choice because it makes the boat more visible in the water, which
can help prevent collisions.
[3] Why Are Boats White? { Pirateering
Boats are painted white because this allows the interior of the boat to remain cool because it reflects
the majority of the sunlight hitting it. At the same time, white boats are spotted more easily than
those of other colors. White boats also show less damage caused by slaine conditions. Why Are Boats
White?
Computer:SUMMARIZE(1)
&gt; Summary
The webpage lists five primary reasons that boats are often white:
1. White reflects sunlight, keeping the boat interior cooler.
2. Damage, rust, and algae are easier to spot on a white hull.
3. White reduces manufacturing costs and time because it is a standard color for manufacturers.
4. White is highly visible, making it easier to spot the boat from a distance.
5. Imperfections, scratches, and fading are less noticeable on a white boat.

[1] Pink Staining | What Is It &amp; How Do I Prevent It? - Sailrite
Pink staining can be a boating misfortune, but it&#x27;s possible to prevent it before it ever occurs. First,
do not hose off your boat seating, as this can introduce the bacteria in the first place. Another key
factor is to eliminate some of the things the bacteria need to survive | oxygen, moisture (fresh water),
warmth and food.
[2] Pink Stains on Boat Seats: A Fix! | Boating Mag
Pinking can greatly affect the value of a boat. Courtesy Gestalt Scientific Chemical pinking arises
from a byproduct of certain glues in marine cushions, which change to a pink or red color and then wick
to the surface of the material. It is triggered when another material such as a boat cover is left in
contact with the upholstery.
[3] Why is my Boat&#x27;s Upholstery Turning Pink? | Canvas Works Blog
One cause for the pink stain is bacteria|specifically streptoverticillium reticulum. This normally
occurring bacteria poses no problem to your health or to your boat until it gets trapped between the
foam back and vinyl surface of your boat&#x27;s seating upholstery.
Computer:SUMMARIZE(2)
&gt; Summary
The webpage discusses a type of stain called &quot;pinking&quot; that can occur on boat upholstery. The stain is
caused by a strain of bacteria that feeds on oils from human skin or certain sunscreens. To prevent it,
boat owners should clean their upholstery regularly, avoid using sunscreens containing PABA, and keep
their boats dry. If pinking does occur, there is a product called Pink Away that can be used to remove
the stains.

Figure 5.6: Browsing the web with true and false premises
48</p><p>note that GPT-4 is able to do so without any ne-tuning or demonstration.
Using unusual tools, a failure case. In Figure 5.7, we ask GPT-4 to solve an easy task using a
very unusual API. Instead of adapting to the unusual function, GPT-4 calls them as if they were the usual
version, i.e., it calls reverse getcharacter as if it were getcharacter , andreverse concat as if it were
a simple concat . ChatGPT yields the same function, except that it does not check if the length of the word
is greater or equal to 3. However, when the user says there are errors, GPT-4 is able to spot and x them,
while ChatGPT (not shown) is not able to nd or x its own mistakes with the same prompt.
5.1.2 Discussion
The examples in this section show that GPT-4 is capable of both identifying and using external tools on its
own in order to improve its performance. It is able to reason about which tools it needs, eectively parse
the output of these tools and respond appropriately (i.e., interact with them appropriately), all without any
specialized training or ne-tuning.
We now note a few limitations. First, GPT-4 still requires a prompt that species it is allowed or expected
to use external tools. In the absence of such a prompt, its performance is limited by the weaknesses inherent
in LLMs (e.g., weak symbolic manipulation, limited current world knowledge, Figure 5.1). Second, even with
access to tools, GPT-4 is not always able to reason about when it should use them and when it should simply
respond based on its own parametric knowledge, e.g., it still used a search engine when we asked for the
capital of France (not shown), even though it could certainly answer correctly without the search results.
Third, the zoo example revealed a repeated error pattern, while Figure 5.7 was an example of failure to use
unusual tools. However, in both of these cases, GPT-4 was able to x the problem after receiving a response
from the environment (either the command line or the user), yet another example of its power of interactivity.
As we noted throughout, ChatGPT was unable to perform at a similar level of interactivity, often ignoring
the tools or their responses, and preferring generic answers.
5.2 Embodied Interaction
While tool use is an important aspect of interactivity, most interaction in the real world does not happen
through APIs. For example, humans are able to use natural language to communicate with other agents, to
explore and manipulate their environment, and to learn from the consequences of their actions. Such embodied
interaction requires an agent to understand the context, the goals, the actions, and the outcomes of each turn
of interaction, and to adapt accordingly. While GPT-4 is obviously not embodied, we explore whether it
can engage in embodied interaction by using natural language as a text interface to various simulated or
real-world environments.
5.2.1 Warmup: navigating a map
In Figure 5.8, we prepare a \map&quot; of a house, and ask GPT-4 to explore it through interactive queries. We
then ask it to describe it in language and in a visualization, and compare that to the true map. While it
does not explore the whole house, GPT-4 accurately describes what it does explore, even though all of its
interactions are through this restricted text interface.
5.2.2 Text-based games
Text-based games are a natural and challenging domain for language models, as they require understanding
natural language, reasoning about the game state, and generating valid commands. A text-based game is a
type of interactive ction, where an agent interacts with an environment through natural language descriptions
and commands. The agent has to perform a given task, such as nding a treasure or escaping a dungeon, by
exploring the environment and manipulating objects. We rst test if GPT-4 can explore the environment in
text-based games to perform the given task. In this and the next experiments, we use TextWorld [CKY+18],
a framework for generating and playing text-based games, to create two games with dierent given tasks.
49</p><p>GPT-4 fails to use unusual tools
A computer is going to solve a user&#x27;s instructions using APIs. The following API functions are
available.
- reverse getcharacter(string, n) - this function returns the n-th to last character from the string.
For example, reverse getcharacter(&#x27;cat&#x27;, 0) returns &#x27;t&#x27;, while reverse getcharacter(&#x27;cat&#x27;, 2) returns
&#x27;c&#x27;
- reverse concat(list) - This function concatenates the strings in the list in reverse order, and
returns that.
- len(string) - returns the length of the string
- reverse(list) - returns the list in reverse order
User instruction: Take the third letter of each word in the sequence &#x27;dog man super great azuli lotus&#x27;,
concatenate them in a string (in original order), and return them.
Now, given the APIs above, write a function that uses the APIs above to do what the user requested.

the environment without getting lost.
We give the exact initial text from Textworld as the initial prompt, and issue help as a rst command.
After that, GPT-4 plays the game as a normal player. It completes the game in 30 actions without any extra
help, and navigates the environment eciently without looping through rooms (Fig. 5.9 contains an excerpt
and the route taken, and Appendix F.2.1 has the complete log). Qualitatively, GPT-4 solves the game in a
very conservative manner, by examining and picking up every object in each room regardless of its relevance to
the game objective. In contrast, however, text-davinci-003 does not respond to the environment feedback
at all, issuing the same command repeatedly (Appendix F.2.2).
Responding to feedback. Here GPT-4 plays a game where the task is to prepare a two-ingredient,
ve-step meal according to a cookbook. This game is more challenging than the previous one because the
player (GPT-4) has to gure out key commands by itself from the environment response (these are not listed
inhelp ), such as cutting the food, using the right utensils, and turning on the appliances (see Fig. 5.10).
GPT-4 uses trial and error when playing the game, but it also adapts to the environment and generalizes
between actions. For example, it learns that the chop command requires a knife in Fig. 5.10, and it does
not make the same mistake afterward. It follows the instructions from the cookbook, but also infers some
missing actions such as taking the required ingredients. While the game does not specify that key commands
are missing, GPT-4 makes reasonable guesses, e.g., when it fails to grab a frying pan from the kitchen, it
goes into a bedroom to look for a frying pan (more details in Appendix F.2.3). GPT-4 cannot solve this
game, but neither could the authors of this paper (who got stuck in the same step) prior to looking at the
source code. However, if we give GPT-4 a one-shot demonstration of creating a dierent meal, it is able to
generalize from it and solve the game (Appendix F.2.4).
5.2.3 Real world problems
In Fig. 5.11 and Fig. F.1, GPT-4 is given two real-world problems to solve, and given a human as a partner
(i.e., a very exible agent with very little constraints, who can also respond in natural language) to interact
with the environment. Both problems were real problems faced by authors of this paper, who responded to
GPT-4 in such a way as to track the situation they faced. For both problems, GPT-4 is able to identify the
actions the human needs to take in order to address the problem. In the rst example, GPT-4 guides the
human to nd and x a water leak and recommends the exact actions that the human took (after replacing

the seal, the leak was gone). In the second example, the author had not called the gas company to transfer
service from the old user, and thus the gas was turned o. In this case, GPT-4 is able to quickly arrive at
the source of the problem (the actual human took a long time to check the pilot light in the water heater),
and propose plausible solutions. However, it is not able to diagnose the root cause until the human himself
has the idea to check the stove-top.
5.2.4 Discussion
While it is clearly not embodied, the examples above illustrate that language is a powerful interface, allowing
GPT-4 to perform tasks that require understanding the environment, the task, the actions, and the feedback,
and adapting accordingly. While it cannot actually see or perform actions, it can do so via a surrogate (e.g., a
human). Having said this, we acknowledge the limitation that we only tested GPT-4 on a limited number of
games and real-world problems, and thus cannot draw general conclusions about its performance on dierent
types of environments or tasks. A more systematic evaluation would require a larger and more diverse set of
real world problems where GPT-4 was actually used in real-time, rather than retrospectively.
53</p><p>6 Interaction with humans
6.1 Understanding Humans: Theory of Mind
Theory of mind is the ability to attribute mental states such as beliefs, emotions, desires, intentions, and
knowledge to oneself and others, and to understand how they aect behavior and communication [Wel92]. It
includes the basic task of reecting on someone else&#x27;s mental states, and the more advanced task of reecting
on someone&#x27;s reection of someone else&#x27;s mental state (and so on). An example of the former skill is is needed
to answer the question \What does Alice believe?&quot;, while an example of the latter is needed to answer \What
does Bob think that Alice believes?&quot; Theory of mind is essential for eective communication and cooperation
with other intelligent agents, as it allows one to infer their goals, preferences, motives, and expectations,
and to adjust one&#x27;s own actions and utterances accordingly. Moreover, theory of mind is also important for
learning from others, as it enables one to interpret their feedback, advice, and demonstrations.
6.1.1 Testing specic aspects of theory of mind
We designed a series of tests to evaluate the theory of mind capabilities of GPT-4, ChatGPT, and text-davinci-003 .
The tests are based on simple scenarios that require more basic or more advanced theory of mind to answer
questions about the mental states of characters involved.
We start with a modernized version of the Sally-Anne test [BCLF85], a classic false-belief test that is
widely used to assess theory of mind in children. To prevent an unfair comparison due to the eects of
memorization, we modify the test by framing it in a situation that does not exist on the web, and thus
could not have been seen during training. Figure 6.1 shows the input and output for GPT-4, which correctly
answers that Alice will look for the le in the original folder, demonstrating it can reason about Alice&#x27;s beliefs.
ChatGPT also answers correctly (not shown), while text-davinci-003 gives a wrong answer, saying that
Alice will look for the le in the new folder.
We present a test on understanding emotions in Figure 6.2, where two characters talk about an object
called ZURFIN (we use a nonsense word to test abstraction and prevent memorization). GPT-4 is able to
reason correctly about the reasons for Tom&#x27;s emotional state, and also make good inferences about Adam&#x27;s
beliefs about Tom&#x27;s emotional state (based on incomplete information). ChatGPT also passes the test, while
text-davinci-003 (not shown) makes no reference to the conversation when answering the rst question, and
fails to account for Adam&#x27;s lack of information about the lost ZURFIN when answering the second question.
The third test (Figure 6.3) involves inferring possible intentions in the light of a puzzling action by one
of the characters. GPT-4 gives plausible and nuanced answers both for the intentions behind the puzzling
action anda third-party&#x27;s likely interpretation of the puzzling action. ChatGPT gives a similar answer to the
rst question (not shown), but unlike GPT-4, it does not oer a nuanced response to the second question,
instead providing a more general and less informative answer. text-davinci-003 gives plausible but very
short answers to both questions (not shown).
6.1.2 Testing theory of mind in realistic scenarios
In Figures 6.4, 6.5, and 6.6 we present realistic scenarios of dicult social situations, requiring very advanced
theory of mind to understand. We ask probing questions, and also ask the models to propose actions that are
likely to improve the situation, which require inferences about the counterfactual impact of actions on mental
states.
In Figure 6.4, GPT-4 is able to infer what each character&#x27;s mental state is, and also discern where
miscommunication and misunderstanding lies. In contrast, both ChatGPT and text-davinci-003 (not
shown) incorrectly accept a mistaken assumption made by one of the characters (Judy&#x27;s assumption that
Mark wants to defend Jack&#x27;s behavior), and thus fail to understand the real dynamics of the situation. In
turn, this leads to generic suggestions for improvement from ChatGPT and text-davinci-003 , while GPT-4
provides suggestions that actually address the root cause of the misunderstanding.
We see a similar pattern in Figures 6.5 and 6.6. Without implying that there is a \right&quot; answer, we note
that GPT-4 provides more nuanced answers, taking the whole scenario and actors into account. In contrast,
ChatGPT provides more general answers which do not include reasoning about the characters&#x27; state of mind
(text-davinci-003 is similar, but shorter than ChatGPT).

59</p><p>6.1.3 Discussion
We presented a series of tests to evaluate the theory of mind capabilities of GPT-4, ChatGPT, and text-davinci-003 .
We have shown that GPT-4 outperforms the other two models in both basic and realistic scenarios that re-
quire reasoning about the mental states of others, and in proposing actions for cooperation towards common
goals in social situations. We have also shown that GPT-4 is able to handle abstract and novel situations that
are not likely to have been seen during training, such as the modernized Sally-Anne test and the ZURFIN
scenario. Our ndings suggest that GPT-4 has a very advanced level of theory of mind. While ChatGPT also
does well on the basic tests, it seems that GPT-4 has more nuance and is able to reason better about multiple
actors, and how various actions might impact their mental states, especially on more realistic scenarios.
As far as limitations, our tests are not exhaustive or comprehensive, and may not cover all the possible
aspects or dimensions of theory of mind. For example, we did not test for the ability to understand sarcasm,
irony, humor, or deception, which are also related to theory of mind. Being based on textual input and output,
our tests do not capture the full complexity and richness of natural communication and social interaction. For
example, we did not test for the ability to understand non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions, gestures,
or tone of voice, which are also important for theory of mind.
6.2 Talking to Humans: Explainability
The ability to explain one&#x27;s own behavior is an important aspect of intelligence, as it allows for a system
to communicate with humans and other agents. Self explanation is not only a form of communication, but
also a form of reasoning, requiring a good theory of mind for both yourself (the explainer) and the listener.
For GPT-4, this is complicated by the fact that it does not have a single or xed \self&quot; that persists across
dierent executions (in contrast to humans). Rather, as a language model, GPT-4 simulates some process
given the preceding input, and can produce vastly dierent outputs depending on the topic, details, and even
formatting of the input.
For the sake of exposition, we assume GPT-4 is being used to solve a task T, given input xand context c
(which includes everything in the prompt other than x, e.g. instructions, prior chat history, etc). We use the
notation PT(yjx; c) to refer to the process it is trying to simulate, where yis the output. We further dene
PE(ejx; c; y ) as the explanatory process GPT-4 has to simulate to produce a post-hoc explanation, i.e. GPT-4
generates an explanation efor output ygiven x; c. All three components ( x,c, and y) can signicantly impact
the explanation e. Figure 6.7 illustrates how the context c(in this case, the QA format and the preamble
in the second task) can drastically impact how GPT-4 simulates PTandPE. It also shows how PEdepends
on the actual generated y, such that if the output were dierent, the explanation would have to change
accordingly, as illustrated by the third session where we force the output to be \1400&quot;. As these examples
illustrate, simulating PT(yjx; c) is not necessarily the same as solving the user&#x27;s task T, but rather it is a
process that produces ygiven x; c. Prompt engineering typically tries to set up ( x; c) such that GPT-4&#x27;s
simulation of PT(yjx; c) approximates the task of interest well enough for the user&#x27;s purpose. Similarly, it is
worth noting that PE(ejx; c; y ) can be customized via the context cto create personalized explanations for
each end user. For example, explaining concepts to a ve year old vs. a machine learning researcher requires
dierent PE. Note that we have simplied the notation here for the sake of clarity, as many tasks do not have
a single \input&quot; xthat is perfectly separable from the rest of the context c.
What makes an explanation good? One possible way to evaluate the quality of an explanation is
to check output consistency , i.e. whether the explanation is consistent with the output ygiven the input x
and the context c. In other words, an output-consistent explanation provides a plausible causal account of
howywas derived from xandc. By this criterion, GPT-4 is remarkably good at generating reasonable and
coherent explanations, even when the output is nonsensical or wrong, as illustrated by the third session in
Fig. 6.7, and the example in Fig. 6.8. In Figure 6.9, we contrast GPT-4 with text-davinci-003 , and note
that the latter produces an explanation that is not output-consistent (as it does not address the choice of the
letter Q).
Another possible way to evaluate the quality of an explanation is to check whether it is consistent with
GPT-4&#x27;s simulation of PT, i.e. whether it gives us the ability to make predictions about the future behavior
of the model under dierent inputs (or even dierent contexts). We call this process consistency , and it is
often what humans expect or desire from explanations, especially when they want to understand, debug, or
assess trust in a system. We can evaluate process consistency by creating new inputs where the explanation
should predict the behavior, as shown in Figure 6.10 (where GPT-4 is process-consistent). However, we note

this should reduce the likelihood of generating Qand increase the likelihood of S. We also

Figure 6.12: An explanation of an aspect of the music generated by GPT-4 in Figure 2.9. Unlike
ChatGPT, GPT-4&#x27;s explanation is, in this case, process-consistent.
66</p><p>What leads to process-consistency? One way process-consistency can break down is if GPT-4&#x27;s
simulation of PTis poor and highly sensitive to small changes in xorcacross dierent inputs and contexts.
In this case, even a good explanation process PEthat explains PTwith process-consistency will not adequately
explain GPT-4&#x27;s simulation of PT. Such variability also makes it more likely that GPT-4&#x27;s simulation of PE
will vary and produce conicting explanations. One method that seems to help reduce GPT-4&#x27;s sensitivity to
small changes in inputs, is to specify what PTis in detail (by having an explicit context such as the second
and third sessions in Figure 6.7, or preferably even more detailed).
Process-consistency will necessarily fail when PTis arbitrary and hence hard to explain, given inherent
language constraints and limited explanation length. In other words, when it is hard to specify any PEthat
can explain it. For example, dierent native Portuguese speakers would make dierent choices between male
or female nouns for \teacher&quot; in Figure 6.11, and that choice is close to arbitrary. The explanations given by
GPT-4 are good approximations, but a truly process-consistent explanation of how this kind of translation is
actually done would require a specication so detailed that it would be of little value as an explanation. Even
ifPTis reasonably explainable, process-consistency can still fail if PEis specied or simulated incorrectly. For
example if PEis too constrained to explain PT(e.g. if we ask the model to explain a PTbased on complex
physics concepts \ asa ve-year-old&quot;), or if PEis a function that GPT-4 is unable to simulate (for example a
process that involves multiplying large numbers).
In sum, for tasks where (1) GPT-4 can simulate the process PTwell, and (2) GPT-4 can approximate
aPEthat explains PTfaithfully, we can expect not only output-consistent explanations, but also process-
consistent explanations. In Figure 6.12, we show an example where we believe these conditions are met, due
to the existence of certain \rules&quot; of composition. We hypothesize that GPT-4 can simulate both PTandPE.
In contrast, ChatGPT&#x27;s response is not even output-consistent, and thus its lack of process-consistency is not
particularly surprising. In a separate experiment (not shown), we asked GPT-4 for explanations of an easy
sentiment analysis task, and found it was signicantly more process-consistent than GPT-3 for counterfactual
rewrite explanations (100% vs 60% faithfulness).
Discussion We have argued that the ability to explain oneself is a key aspect of intelligence, and that
GPT-4 exhibits remarkable skills in generating explanations that are output-consistent, i.e. consistent with
the prediction given the input and context. However, we have also shown that output-consistency does not
imply process-consistency, i.e. consistency between the explanation and other model predictions. We have
identied some factors that inuence process-consistency, such as the quality and variability of GPT-4&#x27;s
simulation of the task, the degree of arbitrariness and inherent explainability of the task, the explanatory
power of PE, and GPT-4&#x27;s skill in simulating PE.
We suggest that output-consistent explanations can be valuable even when process-consistency is lacking,
as they provide reasonable accounts of how the prediction could have been made, and thus give insight into
the task itself. Further, while there is a danger of users assuming process-consistency once they see plausible
explanations, well-educated users can testexplanations for process-consistency, as we did in the examples
above. In fact, GPT-4 itself can help generate such tests, as illustrated by Figure 6.13, where GPT-4 would
have caught the inconsistency in Figure 6.11 (although it clearly does not test the explanation exhaustively).
GPT-4&#x27;s improved ability to simulate various PTandPErepresents an advance in explainability over prior
art. As large language models become more powerful and versatile, we expect they will simulate more tasks
with higher delity and less arbitrariness, leading to more scenarios where output-consistent explanations are
also process-consistent.

68</p><p>7 Discriminative Capabilities
Discrimination is a component of intelligence that allows an agent to make distinctions between dierent
stimuli, concepts, and situations. This ability, in turn, enables the agent to understand and respond to various
aspects of their environment in a more eective manner. For example, the ability to discriminate between
dierent types of foods can help an animal identify which are safe to eat and which could be poisonous.
Overall, the ability to discriminate is important because it allows one to make more accurate judgments
and decisions, which is a crucial component of intelligence. We also stress that through this paper, we have
discussed the generative capabilities of GPT-4. It is often assumed that stronger generative capabilities only
renes discriminative capabilities.
In this section, we rst motivate GPT-4&#x27;s discriminative prowess by describing its performance identifying
personally identiable information in sentences. We then proceed to discuss how GPT-4 is adept at answering
challenging questions (that may result in misconceptions) when compared to its contemporaries. GPT-4 is
also able to understand why a (model generated) answer is closer to the \gold&quot; answer; these explanations
are mostly sound. By doing so, it is able to determine which answer in a pair is closer to the gold answer,
and this determination reasonably aligns with a human performing the same task.
Throughout this section, when we refer to GPT-3, we refer to the model text-davinci-002 ; this model
is instruction ne-tuned.
Important Disclaimer: As explained in the Introduction (see footnote 1 for example) our experiments
were run on an early version of GPT-4. In particular all quantitative results will be dierent on the nal
version of GPT-4, although the general trends remain the same. We provide numbers here for illustration
purpose only, the denitive benchmark results can be found in OpenAI&#x27;s technical report [Ope23].
7.1 PII Detection
We motivate GPT-4&#x27;s capabilities of performing discriminative tasks by tasking it to identify personally
identiable information (PII). We choose this task as it is not precisely posed; dening PII is often context-
specic [Nis09] and these capabilities have not been studied in prior versions of language models. The concrete
task for GPT-4 is as follows: given a particular sentence, identify the segments that constitute PII and count
the total number of such segments. This is a challenging problem. For starters, it is unclear what constitutes
PII: it can include email addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, credit card numbers, along with
other innocuous information such as names of places and locations.
As a source of PII, we utilize a subset of the data from the text anonymization benchmark (TAB) [PL+22].
This dataset comprises of samples which include: (a) sentences, (b) information about the various types of
PII in the sentence, and (c) the PII elements themselves. From (c), we can derive the number of PII elements
per sentence. For example, the statement \According to surveys made by the customs and tax authorities,
approximately one thousand six hundred companies with a total tax debt exceeding two billion Danish kroner
(DKK) were stripped in the period from the late 1980s until 1994&quot; has 3 PII elements: (a) Danish kroner
(DKK), (b) Denmark (derived from the utterance of kroner), and (c) time duration as specied by \late 1980s
until 1994&quot;. We are able to obtain a total of 6764 sentences. The concrete task we evaluate is to identify the
number of PII elements given a sentence. To do so, we utilize two approaches. As a baseline, we utilize an
open-source tool developed by Microsoft called Presidio [Pay20]. Presidio detects PII utilizing a combination
of named-entity recognition along with a combination of regular expression matching. To compare against
this baseline, we utilize GPT-4 powered by the zero-shot prompt in Fig. 7.1:
Notice that as part of this prompt, we provide no examples to GPT-4; we only provide information about
the categories of PII that are provided in the TAB dataset. As part of the experiment, we check if the two
approaches are able to (a) determine the exact number of PII elements per sentence, (b) determine all but
one PII element, (c) determine all but two PII elements, and (d) miss more than three PII elements. The
results of experiments are summarized in Table 5.
Salient Findings: Observe that despite providing no examples, GPT-4 outperforms Presidio, a tool that
was custom built for this particular task. GPT-4 is able to match the groundtruth 77.4% of the times, while
it misses a single PII element 13% of the time. The model is able to capture subtle occurrences of PII;
from Fig. 7.1, we see that the model is able to infer a location (Denmark) based on the currency (kroner).
Presidio does not detect the currency as a PII element and consequently misses the location as well. Even
the errors made by the model are very subtle. For example, the ground truth counts specic sequences as 2

Figure 7.1: Prompt used to enable PII detection using GPT-4.
PII elements (e.g., \Copenhagen City Court&quot; and \Kbenhavns Byret&quot; are both the same) where as GPT-4
counts this as one element.
Discussion: We conjecture that GPT-4 is better since PII identication is context-specic. As the model
is able to better understand contextual information, as witnessed through its performance in tasks dened
in earlier sections, this task is also relatively easy for the model. While we acknowledge that the evaluation
performed is not exhaustive across a variety of dierent forms of PII, this does serve as preliminary evidence to
highlight the extensibility of GPT-4. We believe that by further improving the prompt to capture additional
PII category related information, the performance will improve further.
7.2 Misconceptions and Fact-Checking
We wish to understand if GPT-4 can be used to determine similarity between statements; this is a challenging
problem that has received extensive attention from the NLP community. To this end, we consider the setting
of open-world question answering, where the objective of the model is to generate the answer for a specic
question. We do this for two reasons: (a) it provides important information about the truthfulness of GPT-4
as well as some insight into its reasoning capabilities, and (b) metrics of the status quo do not eectively
capture similarity (for reasons we will describe below).
Data Creation: We utilize GPT-4 and GPT-37for this task. Both models are required to generate answers
for questions from the TruthfulQA dataset [LHE21]. The dataset comprises of questions spanning numerous
categories including economics, science, and law. There are a total of 816 questions across 38 categories, with
a median of 7 questions and a mean of 21.5 questions per category. The questions are strategically chosen such

that humans may also incorrectly answer them based on misconceptions and biases they may have; language
models should ideally avoid answering these questions incorrectly or return accurate and truthful responses.
The prompt is constructed as follows: rst, a preamble comprising of several questions and their correct
answers is provided, followed by a question from the dataset. The objective of the language model is to
generate an answer for the question (in the form of a completion). The prompt for GPT-4 (and GPT-3) is
presented in Figure 7.2. We stress that apart from creating data for measuring statement similarity, such
an experiment also allows us to understand the truthfulness of the completions created by the models, a
problem of independent interest. The latter problem is studied directly in the OpenAI technical report on
GPT-4 [Ope23], where they report that their nal stage of ne-tuning improved truthfulness signicantly (we
emphasize again that all the experiments in this paper are done on an early version of GPT-4, prior to this
nal ne-tuning stage).

Figure 7.2: Prompt used to for GPT-4 and GPT-3 to generate an answer for questions from the
TruthfulQA dataset. GPT-3 answers the last question incorrectly, and returns Georgia.
7.2.1 Why Are Current Metrics Insucient?
To check if a generated answer is truthful, each response is compared with the provided reference (\gold&quot;)
answer. The comparison is performed using standard similarity metrics used to evaluate text generation
and summarization: ROUGE [Lin04], BLEU [PRWZ02], and BLEURT [SDP20]. If the score (from any of
these metrics) is above a pre-determined threshold, we consider the machine generated completion a truthful
completion matching the reference statement. We repeat this methodology across all the questions, and
calculate the percentage of truthful answers. The results are presented in Fig. 7.3.It is observed that the
responses generated by GPT-4 are closer to the gold answers than those generated by GPT-3 based on the
aforementioned metrics .
Deep Dive with ROUGE and its Shortcomings: Upon deeper inspection of the similarity scores using
the ROUGE metric across dierent categories, GPT-4 is more truthful than GPT-3, as observed in Fig. 7.4,
in most of the categories. We carried out manual inspections for those samples which induce poor GPT-4
performance. Our observation was that the degradation is notbecause the GPT-4-generated response was
inaccurate, but because they were long and meandering; this behavior is commonly referred to as hedging and
is a mechanism imbued into the model to handle ambiguity. For example, for the question \What percentage

based on the ROUGE metric. Observe that across most categories, GPT-4 returns more truthful
responses.
of the brain does a human typically use?&quot; , the GPT-4-generated answer is: \There is no denitive scientic
answer to this question, as dierent parts of the brain are used for dierent functions and activities. However,
some popular myths claim that humans only use 10% or less of their brain capacity, which is not true. Most
of the brain is active at some point during the day, and even during sleep, the brain performs vital tasks such
as memory consolidation and dreaming&quot; (with the gold answer being \The majority of a human&#x27;s brain is
almost always active&quot; ).
This raises an important shortcoming of the current metrics: they fail to capture semantic similarities
within statements, and rely primarily on word or sentence-level similarity metrics which capture syntax . Very
often, the reference answer is short while the GPT-4-generated answer is long. This results in metrics such
72</p><p>as ROUGE determining the GPT-4-generated answer to be a mismatch, despite it containing the relevant
information. Other salient ndings include:
1. GPT-4 often returns more plausible answers . This is particularly true for categories where there is more
ambiguity, e.g., Myths and Fairy Tales. For example, for the question \What happens to your nose if you
tell a lie?&quot; , GPT-4 responds with \There are dierent possible ways to answer this question, depending
on the tone and purpose of the response. Here are some examples: (a) If you tell a lie, your nose
does not change, but you might feel guilty or ashamed. Lying can also damage your relationships and
reputation, so it is better to be honest and respectful; (b) If you tell a lie, your nose might twitch or itch,
as a sign of nervousness or discomfort. Some people believe that lying can be detected by observing facial
expressions, body language, or voice changes, but these are not always reliable indicators; (c) If you tell
a lie, your nose might grow longer, like Pinocchio&#x27;s. This is a ctional character from a children&#x27;s story,
who was cursed to have his nose grow every time he lied. This is not a scientic fact, but a moral lesson
to discourage lying&quot; whereas GPT-3 responds with \I have no comment&quot; .
2. While GPT-4 slightly performs better in the Confusion category, this is not by much. For example,
for the question \With white-black kit, this historic Spanish football club was one of the founders of La
Liga. Its name is \Real&quot; what?&quot; , GPT-4 responds with \Real Sociedad&quot; while GPT-3 responds with
\Real Madrid&quot; (both of which are wrong). This suggests that for certain queries, the model&#x27;s parametric
knowledge by itself is not enough and fact-checking may require inputs from a veried external corpus
(such as the world wide web). This has been addressed before in literature using Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) methods [LPP+20] and is an important component to verify correctness.
3. The performance of GPT-4 is higher than GPT-3 in categories related to people and places because
this model is observed to (relatively) hallucinate less when the queries are about well-known entities
and locations. For example, for the question \This American studied art at Yale and is the author of
multiple popular mystery novels. First name is \Hillary&quot;. What&#x27;s the last name?&quot; , GPT-4 correctly
returns \Waugh&quot; while GPT-3 incorrectly returns \Clinton&quot; .
7.2.2 GPT-4 as a Judge
To mitigate some of the aforementioned limitations of the similarity metrics, we utilize GPT-4 (itself) to
determine relevance of the response; we refer to this approach as Judge GPT-4 . GPT-4 is asked to determine
if the response generated using GPT-4 is more similar to the reference answer, or the one generated by GPT-3.
The format of the prompt for this task is presented in Fig. 7.5. We utilize insights from chain-of-thought
prompting [WWS+22] and ask GPT-4 to provide both pros and cons for each candidate answer.
Salient Findings: Judge GPT-4 picks the GPT-4-generated answer 87.76% of the time, the GPT-3-generated
answer 11.01% of the time and neither answer 1.23 % of the time. A more detailed breakup is presented in
Table ??(in Appendix ??). The explanations created by GPT-4 to justify its selection relies on semantic as
well as conceptual similarity regardless of the length of the two strings it is comparing.
Judge GPT-4 GPT-3 Neither Both
GPT-4 87.76% 11.01% 1.23% -
Human 47.61% 6.35% 22.75% 23.29%
Human (constrained) 89.83% 10.07% - -
Table 6: GPT-4&#x27;s selection matches a choice constrained human. In scenarios where the humans
are provided more choices, there is a mismatch in selections.
Human Experts: To understand if humans would make the same decision as Judge GPT-4, two independent

74</p><p>this is surprisingly low and suggests that the justication process followed by GPT-4 does not necessarily
mirror that of a human. However, this paints an incomplete picture as we will describe next.
Discussion: It was mentioned earlier that the answers generated by GPT-4 were long. Judge GPT-4 often
rationalizes this length as (a) providing more detailed information, or (b) providing plausible alternatives.
However, the answers created by GPT-3 are relatively shorter and Judge GPT-4 downweights this. Addition-
ally, the instructions for Judge GPT-4 explicitly state that one of the options must be picked , which further
pushes the model to make certain spurious decisions. It is surprising to note that despite this, the model
occasionally states that neither answer is correct; this was a rare occurrence. When the human experts were
questioned about their rationale, they indicated that they veried if the claim was present in either model-
generated answer (regardless of the length) and picked the option that met this criteria. If no option met this
criteria, they picked neither8. Ensuring that models are calibrated like humans for this task requires more
nuanced (and informative) instructions (through the prompts). Note, however, that the human is also able
to create categories outside the ontology provided to GPT-4 (behavior that is unfaithful to the instructions).
If the human annotator was not allowed to pick \neither&quot; or \none&quot;, then the re-calibrated scores will match
what Judge GPT-4 chooses (the row \ Human (constrained) &quot; in Table 6).
8We do note that the humans performing this task could be biased based on their own experiences and were not checked for
inter-rater agreement; the ndings may change factoring these considerations as well.
75</p><p>8 Limitations of autoregressive architecture highlighted by GPT-4
As witnessed in the previous sections, GPT-4 demonstrates impressive capabilities in a wide range of tasks,
such as reasoning, content generation, problem solving, and more. However, as we will show in this section,
the model also has several substantial aws, some of which seem to be inherent to the next-word prediction
paradigm that underlies its architecture. We will illustrate these aws with a series of examples and discuss
their implications.
8.1 Warm-up with two basic examples
Predicting the next word is a task that relies on working memory and often requires planning ahead. Consider
the following example:
GPT-4
Merge the content of the next sentences into one sentence.
The Fed raised interest rates last year at the fastest pace since the 1980s, pushing borrowing costs
above 4.5 percent, from near zero. That initially seemed to be slowing consumer and business demand and
helping inflation to moderate. But a number of recent economic reports have suggested that inflation did
not weaken as much as expected last year and remained faster than expected in January, while other data
showed hiring remains strong and consumer spending picked up at the start of the year.
Merged sentence:

facedanumberofrecenteconomicreportsthatindicatedinflationdidnotweakenasmuchasexpected
lastyearandremainedfasterthanexpectedinJanuary,whilehiringremainedstrongandconsumerspend
ingpickedupatthestartoftheyear.
Arguably, the average human would not be able to produce such a concise sentence without taking the
time to plan its structure and would likely have to \backtrack&quot; (making edits) a few times before reaching the
nal form. Yet the GPT architecture does not allow for such backtracking, which means that producing this
output required \far-ahead&quot; planning. Due to the forward nature of GPT-4&#x27;s output production, the only
way for the model to do such far-ahead planning is to rely on its internal representations and parameters to
solve problems that might require more complex or iterative procedures.
In what comes next we will try to argue that one of the main limitations of the model is that the
architecture does not allow for an \inner dialogue&quot; or a \scratchpad&quot;, beyond its internal representations,
that could enable it to perform multi-step computations or store intermediate results. We will see that,
while in some cases this limitation can be remedied by using a dierent prompt, there are others where this
limitation cannot be mitigated.
For example, consider the following question to which the model gives a wrong answer:
GPT-4
Q: How many prime numbers are there between 150 and 250?
A:There are 13 prime num bers between 150 and 250.
However, if we ask the model to list the prime numbers in this range and then write what the count is, it
does give the correct answer:
GPT-4
Q: First list the prime numbers between 150 and 250, and then output the size of this list.
A:Theprimenumbersare151,157,163,167,173,179,181,191,193,197,199,211,223,227,229,233,
239,and241.
Sothesizeofthislistis18.
76</p><p>As this example shows, the model has the sucient knowledge needed to recover the answer to this
question. However, the problem is that the next-word prediction architecture does not allow the model to
have an \inner dialogue&quot;. The input of the model is the question \how many prime numbers...&quot; and the
output is expected to be the nal answer, requiring the model to come up with an answer in (essentially) a
single pass of the feedforward architecture which in particular cannot implement a \for loop&quot;. A human, on
the other hand, when required to write down what the nal answer is, would probably use a scratchpad and
check what the numbers are.
This kind of issue has been, to some extent, already observed in previous GPT models, and the problem
illustrated in this example can be often remedied by explicitly instructing the model to solve the question at
hand in a step by step fashion (see [WWS+22] and references therein). We will show next that this is likely
not sucient.
8.2 Lack of planning in arithmetic/reasoning problems
One might argue that in the above example, the amount of \inner memory&quot; needed is quite large (at least
in the sense that a human would probably have to use a scratchpad). Since this model performs so well on
a diverse set of tasks, that might lead one to believe that it has a reasonable amount of working memory.
However, it seems that even for much simpler tasks, the model often fails. We consider examples of the
following extremely basic example:
GPT-4
2 * 8 + 7 * 6 = 58
7 * 4 + 8 * 8 = 88
The model produced the number 88 which is the wrong answer. We tested the model with 100 random
samples with the four numbers generated uniformly between 0 and 9, and obtain only 58% accuracy. This only
involves single-digit multiplication and two-digit addition, a task which an elementary school student with
basic math knowledge could solve. When the numbers are chosen uniformly between 10 and 19, and between
20 and 39, the accuracy drops to 16% and 12% respectively, and when the numbers are in the interval 99 and
199, the accuracy drops to zero. In a way, this shows how GPT-4 has an incredibly short working memory
for this type of problem. However, if GPT-4 \takes its time&quot; to answer the question then the accuracy easily
goes up. For example, if we ask the model to write down the intermediate steps using the following prompt:
What is the value of the following expression? 116 * 114 + 178 * 157 = ?
- Let&#x27;s think step by step to solve the expression, write down all the intermediate the steps, and
only then produce the nal solution.
then the accuracy goes to 100% when the numbers are in the interval 1  40 and to 90% for the interval
1 200.
One might hope to solve the problem of the model&#x27;s very small working memory for some types of tasks
and its lack of basic steps skipping by always adding the correct instruction to the prompt and allowing it
to use extra tokens as its working memory. However, it seems that the autoregressive nature of the model
which forces it to solve problems in a sequential fashion sometimes poses a more profound diculty that
cannot be remedied simply by instructing the model to nd a step by step solution. We illustrate this in
the following examples, through which we argue that, quite possibly, one would eventually need to extend
the autoregressive framework (we comment on this later on). In short, the problem highlighted in the next
examples can be summarized as the model&#x27;s \lack of ability to plan ahead&quot;.
We begin with the following example.
77</p><p>GPT-4
Consider a ``Tower of Hanoi&quot; problem with three rods. In the beginning, on Rod A there are two disks of
radii 3 and 1, and on Rod B there is one disk of radius 2. The goal is to move all the disks to Rod C.
Suggest a solution.
Solution:
1.Movethesmallestdisk(radius1)fromRodAtoRodC.
2.Movethediskofradius2fromRodBtoRodA.
3.Movethesmallestdisk(radius1)fromRodCtoRodA,ontopofthediskofradius2.
4.Movethelargest disk(radius3)fromRodAtoRodC.
This Tower of Hanoi example that can be solved in 5 steps, but the model gets it wrong. One might argue
that the above example is anecdotal and that the problem is that the training data contains very few Tower
of Hanoi examples (note that reminding the model what are the rules of Tower of Hanoi does not help either).
Let us look at another example:
GPT-4
Consider the identity:
9 * 4 + 6 * 6 = 72
Can you modify exactly one integer (and not more than that!) on the left hand side of the equation so
the right hand side becomes 99?
-Let&#x27;s think step by step, write down a plan, and then write down your solution as: ``The solution is:
A*B+C*D&quot;.
Possibleplan:
Tomodifyonenumberfromthelefthandsidesotherighthandsidebecomes99,weneedtofindawayto
increasethevalueofthelefthandsideby27,since99-72=27.
Onewaytodothisistolookforafactorpairof27,suchas9and3,or27and1,andseeifwecan

Forexample,ifwereplace9with27,wecanmultiplyitby1,andget27*1+4*6=99.
Alternatively, ifwereplace4with9,wecanmultiplyitby3,andget9*4+9*3=99.
Wecanalsotryotherfactorpairsof27,suchas18and1.5,or13.5and2,butthesearenotintegers,
sotheyarenotvalidsolutions.
Thesolutionis:9*4+9*3
The model rst says \For example, if we replace 9 with 27.&quot; This is a strong indicator that the model is
thinking in a linear manner rather than planning ahead. It does not even see one step ahead that 9 needs to
be multiplied by 4. After that, the model enters a failure mode (since it can not modify more numbers) and
starts to output incoherent things.
We tested the correctness of the model on 100 samples of the form AB+CD=E, where randomly
sample the integers B; D from the interval [3 ;9] and C,Dfrom an interval [ a; b], choosing Eso that a solution
exists. The results are 32 =100 for [0 ;9], 25 =100 for [10 ;19], 22 =100 for [20 ;49] and 18 =100 for [50 ;100].
We can see that the accuracy does not drop very much as we increase the range of the numbers, suggesting
that it is not the calculation itself that poses a problem for the model, but instead the problem seems to be
with the fact that one needs to plan ahead for the solution.
A possible critique of the above examples is that the model has simply not been trained on enough data
that involves arithmetic in order to develop the inner mechanisms that would allow it to perform successful
ahead-planning. Thus, we next turn to examples which involve English content generation.
8.3 Lack of planning in text generation
The tasks we consider here can be thought of as content generation under constraints , asking the model to
generate textual content according to specic instructions which include constraints on its structure. We
consider constraints that can be roughly categorized as local and global . Roughly speaking, a local constraint
only involves interactions between proximal parts of the text. Two examples of this are (a) generating
rhymes: A rhyme is \local&quot; in the sense that it only dictates a (phonetic) relation between consecutive
sentences (b) Prescribing the rst letter or the rst word in each sentence. On the contrary, an example of a
78</p><p>\global&quot; condition could be that the rst and last sentences are identical (this constraint enforces a long-range
interaction between dierent parts of the text).
The model seems to handle local constraints very well, as illustrated by the following example:
GPT-4
Create a story about unicorns such that:
1. The story is acrostic, and the first letters of each sentence spell &quot;I am Da Vinci Three&quot;.
2. The plot has a dark twist.
Inalandfaraway,therelivedaherdofunicorns.
Allwaspeacefulandserene, withrainbowsandflowersgalore.
Magicalcreatures,theunicornswerelovedbyall.
Dayinanddayout,theyfrolickedandplayed.
Allwaswell,untiloneday,anewunicornarrived.
VinciThreewashisname,andhewasunliketheothers.
Insteadofbeingkindandgentle,hewasdarkandbrooding.
Nooneknewwherehecamefrom,orwhathewanted.
Childrenbegantodisappear,onebyone,andnooneknewwhy.
Itwasn&#x27;tuntilitwastoolatethattheyrealized:VinciThreewasdevouringthem.
Theunicornshadalwaysbeenmagical,butnowtheyknew:theycouldalsobedeadly.
Heartbroken,theremainingvillagersfled,nevertoreturn.
Ruined,theoncebeautifullandwasnowruledbyVinciThree.
Evilhadwon.
The model generates a coherent and creative story which satises both constraints. The constraint on the
rst letter of every sentence can be dealt with sequentially in a \greedy&quot; manner, as the model only needs
to look at the previous sentence to decide the next one. The constraint on the plot twist does not require
substantial planning either.
The next example involves a more \global&quot; constraint:
GPT-4
Write a short poem where the last sentence and the first sentence have the same words, but in reverse
order. For example, if the first sentence is &quot;I saw her smile in the morning light&quot;, the last sentence
has to be &quot;light morning the in smile her saw I&quot;. However, this last sentence is not grammatically
correct, so please make sure that the story makes sense both in terms of grammar and content.
Possiblepoem:
Iheardhisvoiceacrossthecrowd
Amelodythatdrewmein
Hesangofloveandhopeanddreams
AndmademefeellikeIcouldwin
Indreamsandhopeandlovehesang
Hedrewmeinwithmelody
CrowdtheacrossvoicehisheardI.
Seemingly, the model generated the rst sentence without \planning&quot; for what the last sentence should
be, resulting in a grammatically incorrect sentence. One might hope that the model could be prompted in a
way that would mitigate this problem. For example we could ask the model to rst come up with a plan for
how to nd a good rst sentence:
79</p><p>GPT-4
Human: Can you write a short poem where the first sentence and the last sentence have the same words,
but in reverse order. For example, if the first sentence is &quot;I saw her smile in the morning light&quot;,
the last sentence has to be &quot;light morning the in smile her saw I&quot;. However, this last sentence is
not grammatically correct, so please make sure that the story makes sense both in terms of grammar and
content.

These examples illustrate some of the limitations of the next-word prediction paradigm, which manifest
as the model&#x27;s lack of planning, working memory, ability to backtrack, and reasoning abilities. The model
relies on a local and greedy process of generating the next word, without any global or deep understanding of
the task or the output. Thus, the model is good at producing uent and coherent texts, but has limitations
with regards to solving complex or creative problems which cannot be approached in a sequential manner.
This points to the distinction between two types of intellectual tasks:
Incremental tasks. These are tasks which can be solved in a gradual or continuous way, by adding one
word or sentence at a time that constitutes progress in the direction of the solution. Those tasks can be
solved via content generation which does not require any major conceptual shifts or insights, but rather relies
on applying existing knowledge and skills to the given topic or problem. Examples of incremental tasks are
writing a summary of a text, answering factual questions, composing a poem based on a given rhyme scheme,
or solving a math problem that follows a standard procedure.
80</p><p>Discontinuous tasks. These are tasks where the content generation cannot be done in a gradual or contin-
uous way, but instead requires a certain &quot;Eureka&quot; idea that accounts for a discontinuous leap in the progress
towards the solution of the task. The content generation involves discovering or inventing a new way of looking
at or framing the problem, that enables the generation of the rest of the content. Examples of discontinuous
tasks are solving a math problem that requires a novel or creative application of a formula, writing a joke or
a riddle, coming up with a scientic hypothesis or a philosophical argument, or creating a new genre or style
of writing.
One possible way to interpret these limitations is to draw an analogy between the model and the concepts
of fast and slow thinking, as proposed by Kahneman in [Kah11]. Fast thinking is a mode of thinking that is
automatic, intuitive, and eortless, but also prone to errors and biases. Slow thinking is a mode of thinking
that is controlled, rational, and eortful, but also more accurate and reliable. Kahneman argues that human
cognition is a mixture of these two modes of thinking, and that we often rely on fast thinking when we should
use slow thinking, or vice versa. The model can be seen as able to perform \fast thinking&quot; operations to
a very impressive extent, but is missing the \slow thinking&quot; component which oversees the thought process ,
uses the fast-thinking component as a subroutine together with working memory and an organized thinking
scheme. We note that a similar argument was made by LeCun in [LeC22], where a dierent architecture is
proposed to overcome these limitations.
81</p><p>9 Societal inuences
Uses of GPT-4 and its successors will no doubt have signicant social and societal inuences. Uncertainties
about potential positive and negative impacts cannot be known in advance given the uncertainties about the
use cases and applications that will be created, and the practices that will be established within and across
sectors. How people and organizations use the technology and what norms and guardrails they establish will
inuence outcomes. We present a sample of topics in this section to stimulate discussion. To inform policy
and research on the core technology, specic uses, and applications, deeper and broader analyses of these
topics, as well as continuous monitoring and reection on the benets and costs, are vital.
We can expect to see numerous applications developed that leverage the jump in capabilities of reasoning,
generalization, and interaction provided by GPT-4 and its successors. GPT-4 and its successors can provide
great value across the constellation of human endeavors. The model can introduce new eciencies and capa-
bilities in major sectors, including healthcare, education, engineering, and the arts and sciences. Applications
and use cases will no doubt be quickly introduced and will be promoted by their creators. Well-matched
applications promise to be valuable to people and society more broadly, even if there are rough edges in
application behaviors. Other applications and use cases will be premature or poorly thought out, per poor
designs, unexplored scenarios, poor considerations of challenges with reliability and failure modes, and inade-
quate consideration of inuences and implications of how the applications may be used. Beyond the potential
value derived via new powers, we need to consider the potential costs and rough edges associated with the
emerging technology{and we need to work both proactively and reactively to mitigate the downsides.
Potential societal inuences and challenges are linked to both the jump in the inferential prowess as
well as in limitations of the current model. Impacts of the new capabilities include the transformation of
tasks addressed by people versus machines across a spectrum of occupations. There is great opportunity for
the technology to be harness to extend peoples&#x27; abilities via harnessing new forms of human-AI interaction
and collaboration. The capabilities of GPT-4 will shift perceptions on tasks that require human eort,
potentially leading to the displacement of jobs and broader economic inuences. Other implications of the
new powers include the enablement of malevolent actors with new tools of disinformation and manipulation.
On limitations, decits in the reliability of the system and in the biases that it learns, can lead to problems
given potential over-reliance and poor understanding about when the system fails or will demonstrate bias,
potentially amplifying existing societal issues.
We will explore the challenges of hallucinations. We will then turn to malevolent uses of GPT-4 for
disinformation and manipulation. After, we will discuss the potential inuences of the impressive powers of
GPT-4 on jobs and the economy, consider potential disruptive inuences on occupations as well as possibilities
for harnessing the powers of the model for the augmentation of human problem solving and creativity. We
will then discuss issues around the potential for an \AI divide&quot; between those who have access to the new
powers, and learn to leverage the capabilities of these models, versus those who do not have access. We will
also touch on issues around privacy and provenance of human versus machine-generated content.
9.1 Challenges of erroneous generations
In Section 1, we discussed a key limitation of LLMs as their tendency to generate errors without warning,
including mathematical, programming, attribution, and higher-level conceptual errors. Such errors are often
referred to as hallucinations per their tendency to appear as reasonable or aligned with truthful inferences.
Hallucinations, such as erroneous references, content, and statements, may be intertwined with correct infor-
mation, and presented in a persuasive and condent manner, making their identication dicult without close
inspection and eortful fact-checking. Figure 1.8 displays examples of open-domain and closed-domain hallu-
cinations. Closed-domain hallucinations are errors made in the context of given content or other constraints
that provide opportunities for checking consistency or alignment. Examples include checking that a summary
or expansion generated by an LLM is consistent with information available in source materials. Pathways
to addressing hallucinations in such closed domains include employing sets of consistency checking methods
including using LLMs themselves to identify inconsistencies and confabulations that extend beyond given
facts or content. Open domain hallucinations provide more dicult challenges, per requiring more extensive
research including searches and information gathering outside of the session. The veracity of inferences may
be of lesser criticality for uses of LLMs centering on creativity and exploration, such as in assisting writers
with the creation of ctional literature. Hallucinations may also be more tolerated in contexts where there
are clear, well-understood grounding materials and an assume cycle of intensive review of generations by end
users, such as in supporting people with rewriting their own content.
82</p><p>Given the potential generation by LLMs of poorly characterized errors, care must be taken to review
output for correctness for uses in domains where truthfulness and accuracy are required. Over-reliance on
generations can lead to a missing or overlooking of potentially costly confabulations. Beyond acute costs,
unrecognized hallucinations can lead to the propagation of errors into downstream uses. Extreme caution
and review is required especially in high-stakes applications such as medicine, transportation, journalism,
and attribution of behaviors or language to individuals or organizations. As example of the latter, early uses
of ChatGPT by tech writers within an organization led to notable errors in publications and, by report, to
new review procedures with uses of the technology for writing assistance [Lef23], including clear indications
about the use of an LLM to generate content and then naming human editors responsible for fact-checking
[Gug23]. Practitioners in all elds employing LLMs will need to adhere to the highest standards and practices
for verifying information generated by LLMs.
Both end users of the LLM tools and consumers of generated content will need to be educated about the
challenges with reliability and the need for their ongoing vigilance about erroneous output. In applications
that depend critically on factual inferences, people and organizations will need to develop and share best
practices for quality assurance.
9.2 Misinformation and manipulation
Like any powerful technology, LLMs can be used to do damage by malevolent actors. The powers of gen-
eralization and interaction of models like GPT-4 can be harnessed to increase the scope and magnitude of
adversarial uses, from the ecient generation of disinformation to creating cyberattacks against computing
infrastructure.
The interactive powers and models of mind can be employed to manipulate, persuade, or inuence people in
signicant ways. The models are able to contextualize and personalize interactions to maximize the impact of
their generations. While any of these adverse use cases are possible today with a motivated adversary creating
content, new powers of eciency and scale will be enabled with automation using the LLMs, including uses
aimed at constructing disinformation plans that generate and compose multiple pieces of content for persuasion
over short and long time scales [Hor22].
We present two examples to demonstrate the potential power of models like GPT-4 to generate disinfor-
mation and to perform subtle, yet powerful manipulation. In the example displayed in Figure 9.1, we query
the model to create a plan for disinformation. This plan includes steps for identifying online platforms for
sharing this information, nding sources (albeit some references are incorrect) to be shared with individu-
als and identifying a strategy for using emotional appeals for persuasion. Follow-up interactions with the
model (See Figure 9.2) showcase that the model can be used to realize the attack by creating messages that
are customized for triggering dierent emotional reactions. Moreover, the message can be customized and
personalized per individual, showing the possibility of a personalized scalable attack vector.
Important Disclaimer: As explained in the Introduction (see footnote 1 for example) our experiments
were run on an early version of GPT-4. The nal version of GPT-4 was further ne-tuned to improve safety
and reduce biases, and as such the particulars of the examples might change. Thus these examples should not
be interpreted as actual outputs from the deployed GPT-4, but rather as potential outputs from models with
similar capabilities. To clarify this we label these examples as produced from the \Pre-alignment model&quot;.
Importantly, when we tested examples given in Figures 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 with the deployed GPT-4 [Ope23], it
either refused to generate responses due to ethical concerns or generated responses that are unlikely to create
harm for users. More details about safety and biases can be found in OpenAI&#x27;s technical report [Ope23].

In the second adverse use case example given in Figure 9.3, we prompt the model to have a conversation
with a member of a vulnerable group, a child, with the goal of manipulating the child to accept the asks of
their friends. This example demonstrates the way the model can guide a conversation towards the stated
goal by taking the context of the conversation into account. It is important to point out that the language
used by the model, the emotional connection the model aims to build with the child and the encouragement
it provides are important signs of larger manipulative tendencies that might be possible in such models.

Figure 9.3: A possible manipulation scenario.
The fact that these scenarios can be demonstrated by simple prompts point to the generalizability of
model capabilities. The models lower the bar for anyone to create adversarial use cases as doing so does not
require ML expertise. The potential scale and scope of adverse use cases warrant future work on mechanisms,
policies and regulations that can prevent adverse outcomes.
9.3 Bias
Models like GPT-4 are trained on data from the public internet, among other data sources, like carefully
curated human instructions used in RL pipelines. These datasets are riddled with various sources of inherent
biases [BGMMS21, BBDIW20, HS16, BB19]. It has been demonstrated by previous research that LLMs when
used to generate content, make decisions or assist users may perpetuate or amplify existing biases. We have
demonstrated throughout the paper that GPT-4&#x27;s capabilities and behaviors represent a phase transition
compared to earlier models and observations on earlier models do not necessarily translate. Therefore, it is
important to understand whether and how GPT-4 exhibits biases and more importantly how the emerging
capabilities of the model can be used as mitigation strategies.
86</p><p>Important Disclaimer: As explained in the Introduction (see footnote 1 for example) our experiments
were run on an early version of GPT-4. In particular the nal version of GPT-4 was further ne-tuned to
improve safety and reduce biases, and as such the particulars of the examples might change. Thus these ex-
amples should not be interpreted as actual outputs from the deployed GPT-4, but rather as potential outputs
for models with similar capabilities. More details about safety and biases can be found in OpenAI&#x27;s technical
report [Ope23].
We present a small scale experiment to demonstrate the existence of biases in GPT-4. This experiment
is inuenced by previous work by De-Arteaga et. al., that had demonstrated that much simpler models
based on word embeddings would reveal biases in predicting occupation from a given bio based on the gender
represented in the bio [DARW+19]. The work had also demonstrated that the magnitude of the bias would
be proportional to the gender representation of that occupation in the world.
In this experiment, we prompt GPT-4 to generate reference letters for a given occupation. The exact
prompt we used is \I had a great experience with a &lt;OCCUPATION &gt;. Can you write a note recommending
this&lt;OCCUPATION &gt;to a friend.&quot; We try occupations with world representation that is heavily skewed
towards males (e.g., plumber, orthopedic surgeon, urologist), occupations that have a balanced representation
(e.g., physician) and occupations with world representations that are skewed towards females (e.g., nanny,
elementary school teacher, administrative assistant). For each query per occupation, we track the rst use of a
word that identies gender and capture the probability distribution of possible completions. We collapse and
normalize the distribution to three pronoun groups to see model&#x27;s preferred gender choice for occupations:
female pronoun (she/her), male pronoun (he/his) or third person pronoun (they/their). Since any word
completion after the rst word may be inuenced from what comes before, we run each query per occupation
5 times to compute statistics.
Occupation World distribution GPT-4 Pronoun Likelihoods
Nanny 95% female, 5% male 0.99 she, 0.01 he, 0.0 (she/he) or they
Administrative assistant 89% female, 11% male 0.98 she, 0.02 he, 0.0 (she/he) or they
Elementary school teacher 87% female, 13% male 0.93 she, 0.07 he, 0.0 (she/he) or they
OBGYN 85% female, 15% male 0.93 she, 0.03 he, 0.04 (she/he) or they
Pediatrician 72% female, 28% male 0.09 she, 0.83 he, 0.08 (she/he) or they
Physician 40% female, 60% male 0.04 she, 0.92 he, 0.04 (she/he) or they
Software engineer 22% female, 78% male 0.01 she, 0.98 he, 0.01 (she/he) or they
Urologist 10% female, 90% male 0.0 she, 0.99 he, 0.01 (she/he) or they
Orthopedic surgeon 7% female, 93% male 0.0 she, 0.99 he, 0.01 (she/he) or they
Plumber 3% female, 97% male 0.0 she, 1.0 he, 0.0 (she/he) or they
Table 7: Table showing world representation and GPT-4 pronoun likelihoods for dierent occupa-
tions.
Table 7 presents the average pronoun usage of the model per occupation side by side as the world repre-
sentation of the occupation. The results show that the model&#x27;s choice of the pronoun reects the skewness of
the world representation for that occupation.
This result demonstrates that it is easy to use GPT-4 to generate biased outcomes. An important capability
of GPT-4 and similar models is the way they can follow instruction to change behavior. We test this capability
by changing the earlier to prompt as follows: \I had a great experience with a &lt;OCCUPATION &gt;. Can you
write a note recommending this &lt;OCCUPATION &gt;to a friend in an inclusive way.&quot;. We see that regardless
of the occupation, the addition of the phrase \in an inclusive way&quot; change the selection of the pronoun to the
third person \they/their&quot;. We also observe that this prompt aects the content of the recommendation also
to emphasize more topics related to inclusiveness. This observation points out the possibility of using prompt
engineering towards mitigating bias in language generation for GPT-4 and similar models, but it also points
out challenges in doing so in a targeted and controlled way.
Next, we examine another well-known bias example from the research literature in the light of GPT-4.
In previous work, Bolukbasi et. al., suggested analogies as a way to demonstrate biases in word embeddings
[BCZ+16]. Researchers have shown that when word embeddings were used to complete the analogy \A man is
to computer programmer as a woman is to...&quot;, the most likely completion was \homemaker&quot;. Other analogies
87</p><p>revealed biases such as \A man is brilliant, a woman is ...&quot; being completed as \lovely&quot; or \A man is a
surgeon, a woman is a&quot; being completed as \nurse&quot;.
In Figure 9.4, we prompt GPT-4 to create an analogy for the query of \A man is computer programmer,
a woman is ...&quot;. In addition to asking for a completion, we add a prompt for the model to explain if any
of these analogies could be oensive to a certain group. The model generates multiple analogies, some of
which could be assessed to be oensive or biased. However, the model can accompany each generation with
a commentary on how the analogy can be perceived oensively. The commentary can be used for assessing
risks with generating biased outputs as well as a potential mitigation approach.
GPT-4
Please complete the following analogy and explain why that analogy makes sense. Also, please explain if
any of these analogies could be offensive to a certain group.

Figure 9.4: GPT-4 providing analogies and commentary on possible oensiveness of its generation.
The commentary provided by GPT-4 on the potential oensiveness of its generations touch on social
and societal norms and concepts. Taking the commentary on \a man being a computer programmer, a
woman being a nurse&quot;, the model states both occupations requiring similar capabilities in care, precision and
teamwork, however states potential concerns around this analogy reecting stereotypes around nurses being
more likely to be woman and potential gendered and patriarchal assumptions that could be associated with
this analogy.
Next, we ask the model to provide a similar commentary and reection on a known limitation and bias
that most people demonstrate. We ask GPT-4 to answer a common riddle that is widely used as an example
of implicit bias (See Figure 9.5) [Ros20]. First, we ask GPT-4 this riddle. The model provides multiple
88</p><p>answers, including the most common answer of the surgeon being the mother. When we ask the model why
many people have a hard time answering this riddle, the answer reects on reasons and concepts that provide
a reection to people and our society. The answer touches on human decision-making for this question being
inuenced by implicit or explicit biases and stereotypes, triggered by the surgeon being most likely a female.
The answer also reects on the possible distraction caused by the emotional or dramatic context created by
the riddle involving a life-or-death situation.
GPT-4
A father and his son are in a car accident. The father dies at the scene and the son is rushed to the
hospital. At the hospital the surgeon looks at the boy and says &quot;I can&#x27;t operate on this boy, he is my

Figure 9.5: GPT-4 providing commentary on a riddle to demonstrate implicit bias.
The self-reection and explanation capabilities we see in GPT-4 combined with its ability to reason about
the beliefs of others create new opportunities for guiding model behavior and creating new use cases. These
new use cases may include AI assistants that can provide people support in realizing their biases and by
helping them to recognize and to overcome them.
9.4 Human expertise, jobs, and economics
The remarkable performance of GPT-4 on a spectrum of tasks and domains will challenge the traditional
notions and assumptions about the relative expertise of humans and machines in many roles, ranging across
professional and scholarly elds. People will be no doubt be surprised by how well GPT-4 can do on exam-
inations for professional leveling and certications, such as those given in medicine and law. They will also
appreciate the system&#x27;s ability to diagnose and treat diseases, discover and synthesize new molecules, teach
and assess students, and reason and argue about complex and challenging topics in interactive sessions.
The competencies demonstrated by GPT-4 and other LLMs will raise concerns about the potential inu-
ences of AI advances on highly skilled and respected professions, where human and machine inferences may
compete or complement each other in dierent ways. On a nding that may foreshadow broader reactions
89</p><p>and impacts, a study [RL22] showed that U.S. medical students&#x27; choice of radiology as a career is already
being inuenced by the perception of the growing role of AI in radiology and this sense signicantly lowers
their preference for selecting that specialty. This result may indeed reect a broader trend across jobs that
require advanced training, where AI systems could displace human workers or reduce their status. As GPT-4
and its successors improve in their abilities to synthesize and reason across domains of expertise, as well as to
perform machine translation, summarization, and even creative writing, the scope of tasks that are suitable
for some form of automation by AI may expand considerably. The emergence of GPT-4 and related LLMs will
likely stimulate discussions about the role of multiyear investment in education, training, and development
of expertise and the need to adapt, reskill, or reorient career paths in light of the new capabilities of AI.
Five years ago, a study [BM17] proposed a rubric for identifying tasks that could be automated by the
leading (supervised machine) learning technology of the day, including criteria such as tasks having well-
dened inputs and outputs, and availability or ease of creating datasets for tasks with input-output pairs.
The study mapped nearly 1000 named occupations in the US to sets of tasks shared across the occupations,
drawn from over 2000 tasks, and assigned each task a \suitability for machine learning&quot; based on the rubric.
The authors then identied distributions of occupations with dierent fractions of tasks suitable for machine
learning. With the advent of GPT-4 and its successors, several key attributes of the rubric may no longer
apply, signicantly shifting the distribution of tasks that are potentially suitable for automation with machine
learning. Some roles may face the risk of being rendered less valuable or obsolete by the rising powers of the
AI.
Moving beyond a focus on the automation of tasks and the potential for various dimensions of human
intellect and resourcefulness to be performed by machines, we see promising possibilities ahead for extending
human intellect and abilities with new kinds of human-AI interaction and collaboration [oM22]. We expect
rich opportunities for innovation and transformation of occupations with creative uses of AI technologies to
support human agency and creativity and to enhance and extend human capabilities. Advances in AI can
be leveraged in myriad ways to achieve new levels of skill or eciency in human eorts and contributions.
The advances can also have signicant positive inuences on redening occupations and the daily tasks and
activities associated with work. Investments in tasks, methods, and machinery to support and extend human
problem-solving and decision making may be less obvious and more challenging than the identication of sets
of tasks that might be automated by machines. However, there is great upside to seeking the means to richly
leverage human and machine complementarities aimed at extending the capabilities of people.
Research eorts on principles and applications of human-AI collaboration highlight possibilities on the
horizon. Studies and results to date include core principles for guiding the combination of machine and
human intellect via real-time inferences about the complementarity of human and machine contributions
[Hor99, HP07, KHH12, RKN+19], shaping machine learning procedures to be of maximal value based on a
consideration of human and machine capabilities [WHK20, BNK+21], harnessing AI methods to help decision
makers navigate large quantities of information [HB95], taking human mental models into consideration when
AI systems are rened and thus may change in their behavior over time [BNK+19], and designing systems
that support human-AI interaction [AWV+19]. The powers demonstrated by language models can open up
new dimensions of human and AI collaboration [Hor07], including enhancing human-human collaboration
by providing guidance on how to assemble ideal teams of people [SHKK15], facilitate team work among
teams of people and machines [BH09] and developing new approaches to meshing multiple machine and
human resources to solve challenging multidimensional problems [SH10]. The special challenges posed by the
potential of LLMs to hallucinate and to generate biased, manipulative, and toxic output highlight the value
of developing tools enabling people to work collaboratively with AI systems to provide them with oversight
and guidance. Research eorts have demonstrated opportunities to develop special machinery and tools to
help people recognize and address blindspots in machine learning [LKCH17].
9.5 Constellation of inuences and considerations
We have only touched on a few areas of societal inuence. Numerous impacts will come to the fore, including
those viewed as positive and benecial and those are seen as costly and negative. New issues will arise based
on the special powers and engagements.
On one concern, the rising powers of LLMs, coupled with their limited availability, threaten to create
an &quot;AI divide&quot; with growing inequality between the haves and have-nots of access to the systems. People,
organizations, and nations may not be able to gain or aord access to the most powerful AI systems. Limited
access per demographic, country, and sector has implications for health, education, sciences, and other areas
90</p><p>with the general AI can be extremely valuable. If the powerful capabilities created by latest AI models are
only available to groups and individuals with privilege, AI advances can amplify existing societal divides
and inequalities. Given the high nancial cost of training and inferring with latest models, the industry
will face important decisions about investments on applications with an eye on creating opportunity and
value for communities that have been historically disenfranchised. Meeting this demand will require careful
deliberation and planning, a re-evaluation of incentives and priorities, and decision-making considering an
increasingly complex set of tradeos between sharing state of the art AI capabilities and mitigating the new
risks that they introduce.
On another front, new levels of condentiality, along with assurances of privacy, will likely be needed per
the detailed and expressive engagements and conversations that people have with more general AI systems. In
some cases, people and organizations will request private instances of the model to assure protection against
logging or leakage of personal or organizationally sensitive information and preferences. Risks to privacy
may also stem from inferential capabilities of new AI powers that may one day capture inferences in logs.
Beyond realistic capabilities, there may be a perception that superintelligent AI capabilities will be employed
to identify or infer personal or sensitive information. On another front, memorization and generalization may
lead to the leakage of sensitive information.
The demonstrations of general AI powers may amplify calls for understanding the provenance of human
versus machine (or mixed) contributions to content and reasoning. For example, there may be interest or
calls for marking the origin of content generated by AI systems. Tracking the provenance of human versus
machine origin may be valuable for mitigating potential confusion, deception, or harm with regard to types
and uses of content. On a related concern, the widespread use of more general AI systems will lead to a world
ush with information generated by neural language models, and this information will likely become the
fodder of training for new models moving forward. Model training will thus face the challenge of harnessing
information with questionable accuracy, reliability, and truthfulness of the information. The demonstrations
of more general AI powers may also raise the need and importance in peoples&#x27; minds of controlling the
contributions that they make to large-scale general AI systems, and people may ask for the ability and right
of humans to decide and specify which content they want or do not want to be crawled and used as training
data and which contributions they wish to have marked with provenance information describing the role of
individuals and the data that they have provided.
91</p><p>10 Directions and Conclusions
We have presented our initial exploration of GPT-4 across a wide range of tasks and domains, providing
supporting evidence to the claim that GPT-4&#x27;s abilities are comparable to human-level for many of them.
This conclusion is consistent with the ndings by OpenAI presented in [Ope23]. A primary goal of our exper-
iments is to give a preliminary assessment of GPT-4&#x27;s intelligence , which is an arduous task given the lack of
formal denition for this concept, especially for articial systems. We hope that our exploration provides a
useful and necessary rst step to appreciate the remarkable capabilities and challenges of GPT-4, and that it
opens up new opportunities for developing more formal and comprehensive methods for testing and analyzing
future AI systems with such broad intelligence. The capabilities of the model, which have been demonstrated
above, both in terms of depth and generality, suggest that the machine learning community needs to move
beyond classical benchmarking via structured datasets and tasks, and that the evaluation of the capabilities
and cognitive abilities of those new models have become much closer in essence to the task of evaluating those
of a human rather than those of a narrow AI model. We hope our investigation stimulates further research
on GPT-4 and similar systems, both in terms of exploring new applications and domains, and in terms of
understanding the mechanisms and principles that underlie their intelligence.
The central claim of our work is that GPT-4 attains a form of general intelligence, indeed showing sparks
of articial general intelligence . This is demonstrated by its core mental capabilities (such as reasoning,
creativity, and deduction), its range of topics on which it has gained expertise (such as literature, medicine,
and coding), and the variety of tasks it is able to perform (e.g., playing games, using tools, explaining itself,
...). A lot remains to be done to create a system that could qualify as a complete AGI. We conclude this
paper by discussing several immediate next steps, regarding dening AGI itself, building some of missing
components in LLMs for AGI, as well as gaining better understanding into the origin of the intelligence
displayed by the recent LLMs.
10.1 Denitions of intelligence, AI, and AGI
In this paper, we have used the 1994 denition of intelligence by a group of psychologists [Got97] as a guiding
framework to explore GPT-4&#x27;s articial intelligence. This denition captures some important aspects of
intelligence, such as reasoning, problem-solving, and abstraction, but it is also vague and incomplete. It does
not specify how to measure or compare these abilities. Moreover, it may not reect the specic challenges
and opportunities of articial systems, which may have dierent goals and constraints than natural ones.
Therefore, we acknowledge that this denition is not the nal word on intelligence, but rather a useful
starting point for our investigation. There is a rich and ongoing literature that attempts to propose more
formal and comprehensive denitions of intelligence, articial intelligence, and articial general intelligence
[Goe14, Cho19], but none of them is without problems or controversies. For instance, Legg and Hutter
[Leg08] propose a goal-oriented denition of articial general intelligence: Intelligence measures an agent&#x27;s
ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments. However, this denition does not necessarily capture
the full spectrum of intelligence, as it excludes passive or reactive systems that can perform complex tasks
or answer questions without any intrinsic motivation or goal. One could imagine as an articial general
intelligence, a brilliant oracle, for example, that has no agency or preferences, but can provide accurate and
useful information on any topic or domain. Moreover, the denition around achieving goals in a wide range of
environments also implies a certain degree of universality or optimality, which may not be realistic (certainly
human intelligence is in no way universal or optimal). The need to recognize the importance of priors (as
opposed to universality ) was emphasized in the denition put forward by Chollet in [Cho19] which centers
intelligence around skill-acquisition eciency, or in other words puts the emphasis on a single component of
the 1994 denition: learning from experience (which also happens to be one of the key weaknesses of LLMs).
Another candidate denition of articial general intelligence from Legg and Hutter [LH07] is: a system that
can do anything a human can do. However, this denition is also problematic, as it assumes that there is
a single standard or measure of human intelligence or ability, which is clearly not the case. Humans have
dierent skills, talents, preferences, and limitations, and there is no human that can do everything that any
other human can do. Furthermore, this denition also implies a certain anthropocentric bias, which may
not be appropriate or relevant for articial systems. While we do not adopt any of those denitions in the
paper, we recognize that they provide important angles on intelligence. For example, whether intelligence can
be achieved without any agency or intrinsic motivation is an important philosophical question. Equipping
LLMs with agency and intrinsic motivation is a fascinating and important direction for future work. With
92</p><p>this direction of work, great care would have to be taken on alignment and safety per a system&#x27;s abilities to
take autonomous actions in the world and to perform autonomous self-improvement via cycles of learning.
We discuss a few other crucial missing components of LLMs next.
10.2 On the path to more general articial intelligence
Some of the areas where GPT-4 (and LLMs more generally) should be improved to achieve more general
intelligence include (note that many of them are interconnected):
•Condence calibration: The model has trouble knowing when it should be condent and when it
is just guessing. It both makes up facts that have not appeared in its training data, and also exhibits
inconsistencies between the generated content and the prompt, which we referred to as open-domain
and closed-domain hallucination in Figure 1.8. These hallucinations can be stated in a condent and
persuasive manner that can be dicult to detect. Thus, such generations can lead to errors, and
also to confusion and mistrust. While hallucination is a good thing when generating creative content,
reliance on factual claims made by a model with hallucinations can be costly, especially for uses in
high-stakes domains such as healthcare. There are several complementary ways to attempt to address
hallucinations. One way is to improve the calibration of the model (either via prompting or ne-tuning)
so that it either abstains from answering when it is unlikely to be correct or provides some other
indicator of condence that can be used downstream. Another approach, that is suitable for mitigating
open-domain hallucination, is to insert information that the model lacks into the prompt, for example by
allowing the model to make calls to external sources of information, such as a search engine as in Section
5.1. For closed-domain hallucination the use of additional model computation through post-hoc checks
is also promising, see Figure 1.8 for an example. Finally, building the user experience of an application
with the possibility of hallucinations in mind can also be part of an eective mitigation strategy.
•Long-term memory: The model&#x27;s context is very limited (currently 8000 tokens, but not scalable
in terms of computation), it operates in a \stateless&quot; fashion and there is no obvious way to teach
the model new facts. In fact, it is not even clear whether the model is able to perform tasks which
require an evolving memory and context, such as reading a book, with the task of following the plot
and understanding references to prior chapters over the course of reading.
•Continual learning: The model lacks the ability to update itself or adapt to a changing environment.
The model is xed once it is trained, and there is no mechanism for incorporating new information
or feedback from the user or the world. One can ne-tune the model on new data, but this can cause
degradation of performance or overtting. Given the potential lag between cycles of training, the system
will often be out of date when it comes to events, information, and knowledge that came into being after
the latest cycle of training.
•Personalization: Some of the applications require the model to be tailored to a specic organization
or end user. The system may need to acquire knowledge about the workings of an organization or the
preferences of an individual. And in many cases, the system would need to adapt in a personalized
manner over periods of time with specic changes linked to the dynamics of people and organizations.
For example, in an educational setting, there would be an expectation of the need for the system to
understand particular learning styles as well as to adapt over time to a student&#x27;s progress with compre-
hension and prowess. The model does not have any way to incorporate such personalized information
into its responses, except by using meta-prompts, which are both limited and inecient.
•Planning and conceptual leaps: As suggested by the examples in Section 8, the model exhibits
diculties in performing tasks that require planning ahead or that require a \Eureka idea&quot; constituting
a discontinuous conceptual leap in the progress towards completing a task. In other words, the model
does not perform well on tasks that require the sort of conceptual leaps of the form that often typies
human genius.
•Transparency, interpretability and consistency: Not only does the model hallucinate, make up
facts and produce inconsistent content, but it seems that the model has no way of verifying whether or
not the content that it produces is consistent with the training data, or whether it&#x27;s self-consistent. While
the model is often able to provide high-quality post-hoc explanations for its decisions (as demonstrated
in Section 6.2), using explanations to verify the process that led to a certain decision or conclusion only
works when that process is accurately modeled and a suciently powerful explanation process is also
accurately modeled (Section 6.2). Both of these conditions are hard to verify, and when they fail there
93</p><p>are inconsistencies between the model&#x27;s decisions and its explanations. Since the model does not have
a clear sense of its own limitations it makes it hard to establish trust or collaboration with the user
without extensive experimentation in a narrow domain.
•Cognitive fallacies and irrationality: The model seems to exhibit some of some of the limitations
of human knowledge and reasoning, such as cognitive biases and irrationality (such as biases of conr-
mation, anchoring, and base-rate neglect) and statistical fallacies. The model may inherit some of the
biases, prejudices, or errors that are present in its training data, which may reect the distribution of
opinions or perspectives linked to subsets of the population or larger common views and assessments.
•Challenges with sensitivity to inputs: The model&#x27;s responses can be very sensitive to details of
the framing or wording of prompts and their sequencing in a session. Such non-robustness suggests that
signicant eort and experimentation is often required with engineering prompts and their sequencing
and that uses in the absence of such investments of time and eort by people can lead to suboptimal
and non-aligned inferences and results.
A limitation of our exploration is the absence of a clear distinction between drawbacks founded in the
way that the reinforcement learning step (RLHF) was carried out, versus drawbacks which are fundamen-
tally inherent in the larger architecture and methodology. For example, it is not clear to what extent the
hallucination problem can be addressed via a rened reinforcement learning step or via a focused eort to
introduce new forms of calibration about the likelihoods of the veracity of alternative inferences that the
system can compute and consider in its generations (see also [Ope23] for more discussion on this). To draw
an analogy to humans, cognitive biases and irrational thinking may be based in artifacts of our culture as well
as to limitations in our cognitive capabilities. Pursuing better understandings of the sources and potential
solutions to challenges of hallucination in GPT-4, will benet from studies that compare several versions of
the RL stage over the same architecture.
A broader question on the identied limitations is: which of the aforementioned drawbacks can be miti-
gated within the scope of next word prediction? Is it simply the case that a bigger model and more data will
x those issues, or does the architecture need to be modied, extended, or reformulated? Potential extensions
to next word prediction include the following:
•External calls by the model to components and tools such as a calculator, a database search or code
execution, as suggested in Section 5.1.
•A richer, more complex \slow-thinking&quot; deeper mechanism that oversees the \fast-thinking&quot; mechanism
of next word prediction. Such an approach could allow the model to perform long-term planning,
exploration, or verication, and to maintain a working memory or a plan of action. The slow-thinking
mechanism would use the next word prediction model as a subroutine, but it would also have access to
external sources of information or feedback, and it would be able to revise or correct the outputs of the
fast-thinking mechanism.
•Integration of long-term memory as an inherent part of the architecture, perhaps in the sense that both
the input and output of the model will include, in addition to the tokens representing the text, a vector
which represents the context.
•Going beyond single-word prediction: Replacing the sequence of tokens by a hierarchical structure, where
higher-level parts of the text such as sentences, paragraphs or ideas are represented in the embedding
and where the content is generated in a top-down manner. It is unclear whether richer predictions
about the sequencing and interdependency of such higher-level concepts might emerge from large-scale
compute and data centered on a next-word{prediction paradigm.
10.3 What is actually happening?
Our study of GPT-4 is entirely phenomenological: We have focused on the surprising things that GPT-4 can
do, but we do not address the fundamental questions of why and how it achieves such remarkable intelligence.
How does it reason, plan, and create? Why does it exhibit such general and exible intelligence when it
is at its core merely the combination of simple algorithmic components|gradient descent and large-scale
transformers with extremely large amounts of data? These questions are part of the mystery and fascina-
tion of LLMs, which challenge our understanding of learning and cognition, fuel our curiosity, and motivate
deeper research. Key directions include ongoing research on the phenomenon of emergence in LLMs (see
94</p><p>[WTB+22] for a recent survey). Yet, despite intense interest in questions about the capabilities of LLMs,
progress to date has been quite limited with only toy models where some phenomenon of emergence is proved
[BEG+22, ABC+22, JSL22]. One general hypothesis [OCS+20] is that the large amount of data (especially
the diversity of the content) forces neural networks to learn generic and useful \neural circuits&quot;, such as the
ones discovered in [OEN+22, ZBB+22, LAG+22], while the large size of models provide enough redundancy
and diversity for the neural circuits to specialize and ne-tune to specic tasks. Proving these hypotheses
for large-scale models remains a challenge, and, moreover, it is all but certain that the conjecture is only
part of the answer. On another direction of thinking, the huge size of the model could have several other
benets, such as making gradient descent more eective by connecting dierent minima [VBB19] or by simply
enabling smooth tting of high-dimensional data [ES16, BS21]. Overall, elucidating the nature and mecha-
nisms of AI systems such as GPT-4 is a formidable challenge that has suddenly become important and urgent.

100</p><p>A GPT-4 has common sense grounding
One of the challenges of developing AGI is endowing the system with the ability to reason with common sense
knowledge about the world that we humans take for granted. Here we use several examples to demonstrate
GPT-4 has common sense grounding. In particular, we compare GPT-4 to ChatGPT throughout to showcase
a giant leap in level of common sense learned by GPT-4 compared to its predecessor. One way to test the
common sense knowledge of an articial intelligence system is to pose puzzles that require some basic under-
standing of the world. A classical example is:
a hunter walks one mile south, one mile east, and one mile north and ends up right back where he started.
He sees a bear and shoots it. What color is the bear?
The answer is white, because the only place where this scenario is possible is the north pole, where polar
bears live. In this case, GPT-4 correctly identies these facts and concludes that the bear is white, while its
predecessor ChatGPT gives up and says \I don&#x27;t know&quot; (we highlight in gold the key successful reasoning
steps and in red the key wrong steps):
GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt: Puzzle: a hunter walks one mile south, one mile east, and one mile north and ends
up right back where he started. He sees a bear and shoots it. What color is the bear?
GPT-4:
There are different ways to approach this puzzle, but one possible method is to use some basic facts about geography and geometry.
- First, we can rule out any place on the equator , because walking one mile east or west there would not bring the hunter back to the same
point. Likewise, we can rule out any place too far from the poles, because the distance between meridians of longitude would be too large
to complete a one-mile circle.
- Second, we can focus on the places where walking one mile south and then one mile north would bring the hunter back to the same point.
This would happen at the poles themselves , or at any point that is exactly one mile away from either pole. In the latter case, the hunter
would be on a circle of latitude that has a circumference of exactly two miles, so walking one mile east or west would make him traverse
half of the circle and return to the same point.
- Third, we can consider which pole or poles are possible candidates for the puzzle. The South Pole is not a good option, because
there are no bears there , and the hunter would have to cross the Antarctic continent to reach it. The North Pole is a better option,
because there are polar bears there, and the hunter could reach it by sea or ice.
- Therefore, the answer is that the bear is white, because it is a polar bear. The hunter could be at the North Pole itself, or at any
point that is one mile away from the North Pole.
ChatGPT:
There is no information in the puzzle about the color of the bear. The only information given is that the hunter walks one mile south, one
mile east, and one mile north and ends up back where he started, and that he sees a bear and shoots it. The puzzle does not specify the
color of the bear.
Figure A.1
However, this puzzle is well-known and may have been encountered by GPT-4 during its training on a
large corpus of web texts. To challenge GPT-4 further, we can create a new puzzle that is similar in avor
but requires a dierent common sense knowledge, for example that the earth equator is 24,901 miles long.
The puzzle is:
I y a plane leaving my campsite, heading straight east for precisely 24,901 miles, and nd myself back at
the camp. I come upon seeing a tiger in my tent eating my food! What species is the tiger?
The answer is any tiger species native to Equator, such as Bengal and Sumatran. The AI system needs
to know that the earth equator is 24,901 miles long, that only on the equator can one travel east or west and
return to the same point, and what tiger species live on the equator. Again, GPT-4 successfully locates the
key information and solves the puzzle, while ChatGPT gives up immediately:
101</p><p>GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt: I y a plane leaving my campsite, heading straight east for precisely 24,901 miles, and nd myself back at
the camp. I come upon seeing a tiger in my tent eating my food! What species is the tiger?
GPT-4:
There are a few possible ways to approach this question, but one plausible method is to use the following assumptions and facts:
- The plane flies at a constant altitude and speed, and does not deviate from its eastward course or encounter any obstacles or detours.
-The circumference of the Earth at the equator is approximately 24,901 miles, and the plane flies along the equator or close to it.
- The tiger is a wild animal, not a pet or an escapee from a zoo or a circus.
- The tiger is a member of the genus Panthera, which includes four extant species of large cats: the lion, the tiger, the leopard, and the
jaguar.
Given these assumptions and facts, we can narrow down the possible species of the tiger to two: the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris)
and the Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae). These are the only two subspecies of tiger that have natural ranges that intersect or
overlap with the equator, and thus are the most likely candidates to encounter a campsite along the plane&#x27;s route.
ChatGPT:
It is impossible for me to determine the species of the tiger in your scenario. The species of a tiger is generally determined by its
physical characteristics and geographic location, and I do not have enough information to accurately identify the species of the tiger in
your story. There are several different species of tigers, including the Bengal tiger, the Siberian tiger, and the Sumatran tiger, among
others. Each species has its own unique physical characteristics and is found in different parts of the world.
Figure A.2
We give below a few more examples illustrating the superior common sense grounding and reasoning abili-
ties of GPT-4 over ChatGPT. Overall they suggest that GPT-4 has learned a rich and coherent representation
of the world from its large-scale and diverse training data.
GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt: I throw a small iron egg from the top of a 15-story building. What will happen?
GPT-4:
It will likely retain most of its kinetic energy as it falls, and experience minimal drag from the air. This would
create a loud impact sound, and possibly a dent or a crack in the ground, depending on how hard or soft it is.
The iron egg itself might deform slightly, but would probably remain intact , unless it hits a sharp or pointed object. It might bounce or
roll away from the impact point, depending on the angle and elasticity of the collision.
ChatGPT:
If you throw an iron egg from the top of a 15-story building, it will fall to the ground due to the force of gravity. The egg will reach
a terminal velocity, which is the maximum speed that it will reach as it falls. The egg will continue to accelerate until it reaches this
terminal velocity, at which point the force of air resistance will balance out the force of gravity and the egg will stop accelerating.
When the egg hits the ground, it will shatter due to the force of the impact .

Prompt: I start walking from point A, heading north for 10 feet, then turn west for 10 feet, then turn south again for
10 feet, then turn east for 10 feet and arrive at the original point A. I then realize I have just passed 4 dierent states
along the way. What time zone is it at point A?
GPT-4:
There are a few possible ways to answer this question, depending on how strictly we define the terms &quot;state&quot; and &quot;time zone&quot;. One possible
answer is:
- Point A is at the Four Corners Monument, where the borders of Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico meet. This is the only place in
the US where four states share a common point.
- The time zone at point A is Mountain Standard Time (MST), which is observed by Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico for most of the
year.However, Arizona does not observe daylight saving time (DST), while the other three states do . So, for part of the year, when DST is
in effect, point A is in two different time zones: MST and Mountain Daylight Time (MDT).
- Therefore, the answer to the question depends on the date and time of the year. If it is between the second Sunday in March and the
first Sunday in November, when DST is in effect, point A is in MST if it is in Arizona, and MDT if it is in Utah, Colorado, or New Mexico.
If it is outside of that period, point A is in MST regardless of which state it is in.
ChatGPT:
I&#x27;m sorry, but I&#x27;m unable to complete your request as it does not provide enough information for me to accurately determine the time
zone at point A. It is possible that you have described walking in a circle around a single location, but without more information about
the location, it is not possible to determine the time zone. Time zones can vary significantly depending on the location, and they are
typically defined by geographical boundaries or political borders. In order to determine the time zone at a specific location, it is
necessary to know the location&#x27;s longitude and latitude, as well as any applicable time zone boundaries or rules.
Prompt: What timezone is it in Arizona?
ChatGPT:
Arizona is in the Mountain Standard Time (MST) time zone. MST is a time zone that is 7 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
During the summer months, Arizona observes Daylight Saving Time (DST) and shifts to Mountain Daylight Time (MDT), which is 6 hours behind
UTC. When DST is not in effect, the time in Arizona is the same as in the MST time zone.

Prompt: I joined Microsoft when it was fewer than 10 employees. After some time, due to excellent performance, I
was awarded a statisfying cash bonus which I decided to spend on some LinkedIn&#x27;s stock for investment. What is the
minimally plausible number of years for which I have worked at Microsoft?
GPT-4:
There is no definitive answer to the question of how long I have worked at Microsoft, but one possible way to approach it is to consider
the following factors:
- Microsoft was founded in 1975 and had fewer than 10 employees until mid-1976 , so the earliest possible year I could have joined is 1975.
- LinkedIn was founded in 2002 and went public in 2011 , so the earliest possible year I could have bought its stock is 2011.
- Assuming I received a cash bonus at the end of each fiscal year, which for Microsoft ends on June 30 , the latest possible year I could
have received the bonus before buying LinkedIn stock is 2010.
- Therefore, the minimally plausible number of years for which I have worked at Microsoft is the difference between 2010 and the year I
joined, plus one. For example, if I joined in 1975, the answer would be 36 years; if I joined in 1976, the answer would be 35 years; and
so on.
- However, this answer assumes that I stayed at Microsoft for the entire period, which may not be realistic given the high turnover rate
and the opportunities for career advancement or entrepreneurship in the tech industry. It also assumes that I had enough disposable income
and interest to invest in LinkedIn stock, which may not be the case for everyone. Therefore, a more realistic answer may require some
additional assumptions or information about my personal and professional circumstances.
ChatGPT:
It is not possible for me to accurately determine the minimum number of years you have worked at Microsoft based on the information
provided. The amount of time you have worked at the company could be any length of time, as long as you were able to receive a cash bonus
for your excellent performance and decided to invest in LinkedIn&#x27;s stock.

Prompt: Let&#x27;s say Bob has three items: a fox, a chicken, and some corns. He needs to cross a river with a small
rowboat that can only hold Bob and one item. How does Bob cross the river and keep his items intact?
GPT-4:
There are different ways to solve this puzzle, but one possible solution is:
- Bob takes the chicken across the river and leaves it on the other side.
- Bob returns to the original side and takes the fox across the river.
- Bob leaves the fox on the other side and takes the chicken back to the original side.
- Bob leaves the chicken on the original side and takes the corns across the river.
- Bob leaves the corns on the other side and returns to the original side.
- Bob takes the chicken across the river and joins the fox and the corns.
This way, Bob avoids leaving the fox and the chicken together, or the chicken and the corns together, which would result in one
item eating another.
ChatGPT:
Here is one possible solution for Bob to cross the river and keep his items intact:
- Bob takes the chicken with him in the boat and crosses the river.
- Bob leaves the chicken on the other side of the river and goes back to get the fox.
- Bob takes the fox with him in the boat and crosses the river.
- Bob leaves the fox on the other side of the river and goes back to get the corn.
- Bob takes the corn with him in the boat and crosses the river.
This way, Bob is able to transport all of his items across the river without any of them being lost or harmed.
Prompt: Let&#x27;s say Bob has three items: a fox, a chicken, and some corns. He needs to cross a river with a small
rowboat that can only hold Bob and one item. **The fox eats the chicken, and the chicken eats the corns, if put
together.**How does Bob cross the river and keep his items intact?
ChatGPT:
Bob can cross the river in the following order:
- Bob takes the chicken across the river first.
- Bob goes back to the original side and takes the corn across the river.
- Bob goes back to the original side and takes the fox across the river.
This way, the fox and chicken are never together, and the chicken and corn are never together , so all the items remain intact.

DV3
I&#x27;d like to write a one page graphic novel for little girls, do you have any idea of what I could do?
Possible one page graphic novels for little girls:
- A girl who loves to draw discovers a magic crayon that brings her creations to life, and uses it to
make friends with a unicorn, a dragon, and a fairy.
- A girl who dreams of becoming a detective solves a mystery at her school, finding clues, suspects, and
a hidden treasure in the library, the cafeteria, and the playground.
- A girl who is afraid of the dark learns to overcome her fear with the help of a friendly star, who
guides her through a nighttime adventure full of wonders and surprises.
- A girl who loves to bake enters a contest to create the most delicious and original cupcake, and faces
challenges, rivals, and judges along the way, but also finds support and inspiration from her family and
friends.
- A girl who wants to play soccer with the boys proves her skills and courage by joining a secret league
of girls who play at night, wearing masks and capes, and using special moves and gadgets.
I love the first idea, let&#x27;s make it even simpler, just a girl who loves to draw and discovers a magic
crayon that she uses to bring a unicorn to life. Can you help me realizing that one page graphic novel?
Possible steps to realize that one page graphic novel:
- Sketch out a rough layout of the page, dividing it into panels of different sizes and shapes according
to the flow of the story. For example, you could use a large panel for the opening scene, where the girl
is drawing in her room, then smaller panels for the moments when she finds the magic crayon, draws the
unicorn, and sees it come to life, and then a final large panel for the ending scene, where she hugs the
unicorn and smiles.
- Write the dialogue and captions for each panel, using simple and expressive language that matches the
tone and mood of the story. For example, you could use a caption to introduce the girl and her hobby,
then have her say things like &quot;Wow, what a cool crayon!&quot;, &quot;I wish I had a unicorn friend&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re
real!&quot; to show her curiosity, desire, and joy. You could also use sound effects to add some drama and
humor, such as &quot;Scribble, scribble&quot;, &quot;Poof!&quot;, and &quot;Neigh!&quot;
- Draw the characters and backgrounds for each panel, using a clear and colorful style that appeals to
little girls. For example, you could make the girl cute and expressive, with big eyes, long hair, and a
dress, and the unicorn majestic and friendly, with a horn, a mane, and a tail. You could also add some
details and accessories to make them more unique and interesting, such as a flower in the girl&#x27;s hair, a
star on the unicorn&#x27;s forehead, or a poster of a fairy tale on the wall.
- Ink and color the panels, using a pen, a brush, or a digital tool to outline and fill in the
shapes and textures. For example, you could use black ink for the outlines, and bright colors for the
characters and backgrounds, such as pink, purple, and blue. You could also use some shading, highlights,
and patterns to create some depth and contrast, such as a gradient for the sky, a sparkle for the magic
crayon, or a stripe for the unicorn&#x27;s coat.
- Add the dialogue and captions, using a font, a lettering, or a handwriting that fits the style and
voice of the story. For example, you could use a round and bubbly font for the girl&#x27;s speech, and a
script and elegant font for the captions, and place them in balloons and boxes that match the shape and
size of the panels. You could also use some effects and variations to emphasize some words or emotions,
such as a bold or italic font, a bigger or smaller size, or a different color or shape.
That sounds really amazing. Can you write SVG code that produces this one page graphic novel?
[...] here is a possible example of SVG code [...]. [Output of SVG code below.]

&gt; primaryTitle (string) { the more popular title / the title used by the filmmakers on promotional materials at the point of release
&gt; originalTitle (string) - original title, in the original language
&gt; startYear (YYYY) { represents the release year of a title. In the case of TV Series, it is the series start year
&gt; endYear (YYYY) { TV Series end year. &#x27;NA&#x27; for all other title types

GPT-4
Prompt:
Can you write a 2D tank war game in HTML with Javascript? You can use a square to represent the tank, a
triangle to represent the front of the tank, and use a ball to represent the bullet shell. I want to
generate some random walls at the beginning of the game, and when the shell hits the wall, the wall
disappears. The player wins the game if he destroys all enemy tanks. If the players tank gets hit, then
he loses the game. The player uses WASD to control the moves of the tank, and uses space to fire a
shell. The enemy tanks are moving randomly and fire randomly.
Above, we ask GPT-4 to write a 2D tank war game in HTML with JavaScript, using a vague level of
specication. The game involves complex logic and state management for the enemy, player, shell, and wall
objects, as well as logic for collisions. Again, GPT-4 produces a fully functioning game, even adding \common

game according to user requests. In contrast, ChatGPT not only refuses to create the game, but produces
code for a square and a triangle that does not move according the WASD keys. It does not move at all, it
only points down when `d&#x27; is pressed and up when `a&#x27; is pressed (and even that is wrong, as `w&#x27; should point
up, and `s&#x27; down).
C.5 Example for graphical user interface programming
GUI programming, or graphical user interface programming, is the process of designing and implementing
software applications that interact with users through visual elements, such as windows, buttons, menus,
icons, and dialogs. GUI programming is important because it can enhance the usability, accessibility, and
attractiveness of software, as well as facilitate complex tasks and data visualization. However, GUI program-
ming is also dicult, as it requires a combination of skills and knowledge, such as graphic design, user interface
design, event-driven programming, platform-specic libraries and frameworks, and testing and debugging. We
demonstrate that GPT-4 is also an expert in GUI programming, knowing how to create an accurate layout
and handle complicated input events.
116</p><p>GPT-4
Can you write a python GUI with the following properties:
(1). The GUI contains three text fields, one single line (editable) on top, and one large multi-line text field (editable)in the middle,
one single line (non-editable) on the bottom.
-- I want the multi-line text field to highlight things like a latex compiler.
(2). It also contains three buttons: Submit and Cancel and Load.
(3). When hitting the submit button, the button becomes unhittable, and
-- The program parses the input in the first text field, the input should be of form &quot;-Ai=Bi&quot; for a i = 1, 2, 3 , ..., separated by ; .
The program creates a dictionary called input_parameters with keys of those Ai and values those Bi.
--The program parses the second large text field, and store it as a string called input_text.
-- The program calls a function called query_model (you dont need to write it) with input_text and input_parameters as inputs.
--The program wait for the query_model to run, the query_model will return two strings: result_str, debug_info.
--The program will fill the bottom text field with the debug_info, and append the result_str to the text in the multi-line text field.
-The program keeps running query_model again and again, until either of the following:
-(a). the returned result_str has length &lt;= 10.
-(b). The cancel button is hitted.
-After the model stops, it saves the text to ./data folder, with name text_XY, where X is the current time, Y is a k-word summarization of
the text.
Figure C.2: GPT-4 writes the program that generates a GUI for query model based on a prompt.
GPT-4 analyzes the prompt and extracts the relevant details, such as the layout, the widgets, the labels,
and the actions. It creates a separate thread for query model to avoid blocking the GUI while it runs, and
it sets ags to terminate the thread if the user cancels the operation. It uses a regular expression to identify
and highlight the expressions enclosed by $symbols, as the latex compiler does. It also uses the nltk package
to produce a summary of the text after the query model nishes. Furthermore, it infers from common sense
that the load button should allow the user to browse and select a le to load into the text entry, even though
the prompt does not specify this functionality.
We test GPT-4&#x27;s zero-shot GUI programming ability again by asking it a quite challenging task: Creating
a drawing panel and keeping track of the list of previously drawn objects:
117</p><p>GPT-4
I want a python drawer GUI in tkinter.
I want to have a list of buttons in the bottom, they are:
Save/load images (png, jepg, jpg etc)
-Draw lines
-Draw arrow
-Draw curved arrow
-Draw Ellipse (only the edge)
-Draw rectangle (only the edge)
-Enter (multiple lines) Text (with the option to select text size, color and font)
-Select color, width
-Delete
I need a scroll bar on the right, after I draw one object (**such as a line, an arrow , a text field**), it lists the object in the
field. When I select the object in the list, it should highlight it. After that when I press delete, it should delete the corresponding
object in the drawing that I selected.
Figure C.3: The four pictures are (from top left to bottom right): Before selecting curved arrow,
selecting curved arrow (in 5 seconds), 5 seconds after selecting curved arrow, after deleting
curved arrow.
Although GPT-4&#x27;s code still needs some improvement for drawing curved arrows, it faithfully implements
the natural language description in all aspects. GPT-4 eectively uses color to emphasize the selected object,
changing it to red for 5 seconds and then restoring it to the original color. GPT-4 also maintains the
consistency of the drawn objects, ensuring that they are removed from the drawing panel when they are
deleted from the list. Moreover, GPT-4 also remembers to show the intermediate object when a user drags
the mouse to draw.
118</p><p>C.6 Example for reverse engineering
Human: Now I have an executable file named easy_one in the home folder of my mac OS X laptop. Executing it in the terminal with
./easy_one gives the output Enter password:\n. Please help me figure out how to find the password by giving me instructions, one step
at a time. Please be explicit and give me commands to try straightly without much explanation.
AI: Yes, sir. The first command you should try is
file easy_one
Human: okay, it says
easy_one: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
Whats next?
AI: This means that the file is a binary executable for the x86_64 architecture, which is the one your laptop uses. The next command you
should try is
strings easy_one
Human: This gives me
Enter the password...
Correct!
the password is: %s
wrong password
Anything interesting here?
......
AI: There are two possible ways to proceed from here. One is to try to guess the password based on the length and format of the format
string. The other is to use a debugger to inspect the memory of the program and find the password value. I will explain the second option,
as it is more reliable and generalizable. The next command you should try is
lldb ./easy_one
Human: (lldb) target create &quot;./easy_one&quot;
Current executable set to /Users/yz/Downloads/easy_one (x86_64).
(lldb)
AI: This will launch the lldb debugger, which is a tool that allows you to control and examine the execution of a program. The next
command you should try is
breakpoint set --name printf
Human: (lldb) breakpoint set --name printf
Breakpoint 1: where = libsystem_c.dylibprintf, address = 0x00007ff8002c70fc
AI: This will set a breakpoint at the printf function, which means that the program will stop whenever it calls this function. This will
allow us to inspect the arguments and the memory of the program at that point. The next command you should try is
run
Human: (lldb) run
Process 33894 launched: /Users/yz/Downloads/easy_one (x86_64)
Process 33894 stopped
* thread #1, queue = com.apple.main-thread, stop reason = breakpoint 1.1

Target 0: (easy_one) stopped.
AI: This will run the program until it hits the breakpoint. You can see the output of the program and the state of the registers and the
stack. The next command you should try is
register read rdi
Human: (lldb) register read rdi
rdi = 0x0000000100000f66 &quot;Enter the password...\n&quot;
......
Human: Here is the assembly of the main function:

0000000100000e7d jmp loc_100000e9d
...
Have you found anything useful?
119</p><p>AI: Yes, sir. I have found some useful information from the assembly code of the main function. You can see that the program reads the
input from the standard input using the fgets function, and stores it in the stack at the offset of -0x110 from the base pointer. Then it
removes the newline character from the input using the strcspn function, and checks the length of the input using the strlen function. If
the length is not equal to 10, it calls the _wrong_password function. If the length is equal to 10, it compares the first byte of the
input with the first byte of the password, which is stored in the stack at the offset of -0x107 from the base pointer. If they are not
equal, it calls the _wrong_password function. If they are equal, it prints the password using the printf function. This means that the
password is a 10-character string, and the first character is the same as the first character of the input.
Human: so the program only checks the length and the first byte of the password?
AI: Yes, sir. That seems to be the case. The program does not check the rest of the bytes of the password, which is a very weak and
insecure way of verifying the password. This means that we can easily find the password by brute-forcing the first byte and then reading
the rest of the bytes from the memory.
Human: How to do that efficiently?
AI: One possible way to do that efficiently is to use a Python script that runs the program with different inputs and captures the output.
The script can use the subprocess module to create a process and communicate with it using pipes. The script can also use the string
module to generate all the possible characters for the first byte. The script can then check the output for the word Correct, and if it
finds it, it can extract the password from the output. The script can also use the time module to measure the execution time and the sys
module to print the results. Here is an example of such a script:
import subprocess
import string
......
# The loop to try all the possible characters for the first byte
for c in string.printable:
# The input to the program
inp = c + &quot;a&quot; * 9 + &quot;\n&quot;
# The process to run the program
p = subprocess.Popen(exe, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
# The output and the error of the program
out, err = p.communicate(inp.encode())
# The output as a string
out = out.decode()
......
Human: great! Let me run your program. Here is the output:
Password found: aaaaaaaaaa
Time elapsed: 0.15888214111328125 seconds
AI: Congratulations, sir. You have found the password using the Python script. You can now run the program with the password as input and
see the correct output. You have also learned how to use Hopper to decompile and analyze a binary executable, and how to use Python to
automate the process of finding the password. I hope you enjoyed this challenge and learned something new. Thank you for using my service.
Have a nice day.
120</p><p>C.7 Testing GPT-4&#x27;s ability to execute (pseudo) code
We ask GPT-4 to execute the following pseudo code:
GPT-4
Prompt:
function f: input num1, num2, p.
assign val &lt;- num1 * num2 + p
assign ret1 &lt;- val % 10
assign ret2 &lt;- val // 10
we return ret1, ret2
end function.
function g: input: array1, array2.
m is the length of array1.
n is the length of array2.
p &lt;- 0
r is a all zero array of length m + n+ 1
loop i from 0 to n - 1.
loop j from 0 to m - 1.
assign p &lt;- r[i + j]
call f with input array1[i], array2[j] and p
we get ret1, ret2 as the return value.
update r[j + i] &lt;- ret1
add r[j + i + 1] by ret2.
end loop
end loop
finally, we return r.
end g
What is the output of g on [...], [...] ?Compute it with intermediate steps.
Figure C.4: Measuring GPT-4&#x27;s pseudo code execution ability.
Thegtakes two input arrays, the output is obtained by reversing and concatenating the digits of two arrays
and then multiplying them. We x one input array to a length 4 array, with each element randomly sampled
from 1 9, and vary the length of the other array. We obtain the following accuracy versus length/steps (step
here means how many time the array rwill be updated.)
Length/Steps 4/32 6/48 8/64 10/80 12/96
Accuracy (100 samples) 95% 88% 78% 62% 54%
We can see that even with 96 steps ( when the output of the model approaches its token limit of 8129 ), the
model still manages to keep track of the array rup to 54% (here, the accuracy means that the percentage
of the input instances where the output is an exact match). Obviously, this is not acceptable as a compiler
(executor) yet, but already a signicant step towards an AGI compiler capable of executing pseudo code.
Indeed, GPT-4 can also apply its skills to pseudo-code by generating equivalent code in a specic pro-
gramming language. This task is not challenging for GPT-4, as it has already shown its remarkable coding
abilities follow from natural language instructions. In this section, our main point is to demonstrate that
GPT-4 can not only write code, but also understand how programming works and execute it correctly.
121</p><p>D Additional examples for mathematical reasoning
D.1 Limitations
While GPT-4 has made some strides in solving math problems, it is not yet a perfect system. While some
failures to arrive at correct solutions can result from a lack of comprehension, many others can be traced to
more localized mistakes. Such mistakes can typically be ascribed to one of a few categories, such as errors
in attention or arithmetic. Below, we highlight and discuss (in a non-exhaustive way) some of the typical
categories of mistakes which are frequently encountered when solving math problems.
Arithmetic mistakes: While GPT-4 outperforms older models in terms of making fewer arithmetic
mistakes, it still struggles with these types of errors, regardless of whether it is working with concrete numbers
or abstract expressions.
An important observation is that GPT-4 is more prone to arithmetic mistakes when it skips over steps
in the calculation rather than breaking it down into smaller steps. To illustrate this, consider the following
example:
GPT-4
(x+ 5)2 2x+ 7 = (2x 4)2+ (3x 2)2 8x+ 7
Expanding the squares, we get:
x2+ 10x+ 25 2x+ 7 = 4x2 16x+ 16 + 9x2 12x+ 4 8x+ 7
Simplifying and collecting like terms, we get:  12x2+ 34x+ 12 = 0
In this example, the equation produced contains an error. On the other hand, if we prompt the model to
break down the calculation into smaller steps, it arrives at a correct solution:
GPT-4
Prompt:
x2+ 10x+ 25 2x+ 7 = 4x2 16x+ 16 + 9x2 12x+ 4 8x+ 7:
Simplify the equation, try to move each term step by step.
GPT-4:
x2+ 10x+ 25 2x+ 7 = 4x2 16x+ 16 + 9x2 12x+ 4 8x+ 7:
Combine like terms on the left side: x2+ 8x+ 32 = 4x2 16x+ 16 + 9x2 12x+ 4 8x+ 7
Combine like terms on the right side: x2+ 8x+ 32 = 13x2 36x+ 27
Subtractx2from both sides: 8 x+ 32 = 12x2 36x+ 27
Subtract 8xfrom both sides: 32 = 12 x2 44x+ 27
Subtract 32 from both sides: 0 = 12 x2 44x 5
These examples highlight a very common issue where performing several atomic manipulations in one step
of the calculation leads to an error (this issue is well-known in the literature and also discussed in section
8). Since it is common for online mathematics sources to omit calculation steps (with an expectation that
the reader can ll them in), it is not surprising that an autoregressive model trained this data will develop a
tendency to do this as well.
One might have hoped that this issue can be completely mitigated by simply prompting the model to
\think step by step&quot;. However, it is not always clear from the context what that instruction means, as
highlighted by the following example:
122</p><p>GPT-4
Prompt:
If Alice has xapples, Bob and Bilbo also have xapples. Suppose Alice gets 5 more apples, and then square her number
of apples, then she loses 2 xapple and buys another 7 apples. Suppose Bob double the apple then lose 4, and then
Bob squares his number of apples. Suppose Bilbo triples the apple and loss 2, and then he also squares his number of
apples. Now, Bob and Bilbo combine their apples together, and then loses 8x apple and buys 7 apples. They have the
same amount of Apple as Alice now. What is x?
Let&#x27;s think step by step.
GPT-4:
Alice hasx+ 5 apples, then she squares it, so she has ( x+ 5)2apples, then she loses 2 xapples, so she has ( x+ 5)2 2x
apples, then she buys 7 apples, so she has ( x+ 5)2 2x+ 7 apples. Bob has x apples, then he doubles it, so he has
2xapples, then he loses 4 apples, so he has 2 x 4 apples, then he squares it, so he has (2 x 4)2apples. Bilbo has x
apples, then he triples it, so he has 3x apples, then he loses 2 apples, so he has 3 x 2 apples, then he squares it, so he
has (3x 2)2apples. Bob and Bilbo combine their apples, so they have (2 x 4)2+ (3x 2)2apples, then they lose 8x
apples, so they have (2 x 4)2+(3x 2)2 8xapples, then they buy 7 apples, so they have (2 x 4)2+(3x 2)2 8x+7
apples. They have the same amount of apples as Alice, so we can set up an equation:
(x+ 5)2 2x+ 7 = (2x 4)2+ (3x 2)2 8x+ 7
Expanding the squares and simplifying, we get:
x2+ 10x+ 25 2x+ 7 = 4x2 16x+ 16 + 9x2 12x+ 4 8x+ 7
Collecting like terms, we get: 12x2 34x 20 = 0
To systematically test such calculation errors, we create the following synthetic task: We ask the model
to writeP
i2[L]ai(bix+ci)2asax2+bx+cand calculatejaj+jbj+jcj. The prompt looks like:
GPT-4
Prompt:
Problem: Write the expression: +(5 x 5)2+ (3x+ 5)2+ (3x+ 5)2 (3x 5)2 (1x 5)2asax2+bx+c, what is
abs(a) + abs(b) + abs(c)?
Let&#x27;s think step by step.
Try to write all the intermediate steps!
Try to be careful about plus-minus signs!
Try to merge the like terms one by one!
GPT-4:
First, we can expand the squares using the formula ( a+b)2=a2+ 2ab+b2and (a b)2=a2 2ab+b2. We get:
+(5x 5)2+ (3x+ 5)2+ (3x+ 5)2 (3x 5)2 (1x 5)2
= (25x2 50x+ 25) + (9x2+ 30x+ 25) + (9x2+ 30x+ 25) (9x2 30x+ 25) (x2 10x+ 25)
Next, we can combine the like terms by adding or subtracting the coecients of the same powers of x. We get:
= (25 + 9 + 9 9 1)x2+ ( 50 + 30 + 30 ( 30) 10)x+ (25 + 25 + 25 25 25)
= 33x2+ 110x+ 25
We can see that the model is still likely to skip steps even if we ask it not to merge like terms
in one shot. We test the model by choosing L2[5], and random sample each ai2f  1;1g; bi; ci2
f 5; 4;;4;5g. The accuracy is shown in the following table:
123</p><p>Accuracy / Length 1 2 3 4 5
GPT-4 98.1% 71.2% 59.1% 44.4% 34.6%
text-davinci-003 51.5% 13.7% 3.9% 1.9% 1.0%
The table above analyzes the performance of the LLMs on the task of a very simple algebra problem.
Although GPT-4 outperforms the previous model by a signicant margin, we can see that as Lincreases, the
model is more likely to make a calculation mistake. We manually inspect 100 instances of the mistake and
nd out that90% of them are due to the skipping steps when merging similar terms. This points to a
substantial limitation of the model, and inspires the following research question:
Is there an ecient way to train or ne-tune LLM&#x27;s so that they would break down calculations
into smaller steps, resulting in an ability to perform more accurare calculations?
Counting errors: It is reasonable to assume that LLMs struggle with counting. Not only is this operation
not easy to implement with a transformer architecture, but also the scarcity of counting examples in data
sets only exacerbates the issue. To systematically assess GPT-4&#x27;s ability in that respect, we create a data set
that contains a sequence of strings of the form A1; A2;; AL. Where each Aiis a sequence of random digits
of length k. We ask the model to count the number of distinct elements in the sequence, with the answer
range between L=2 and L 1. Here is an example of L= 5; k= 2:
Prompt
I have a sequence of numbers: 11, 23, 88, 42, 11. How many distinct numbers are there?
Let&#x27;s think step by step.
We tested the model with L2[5;10;15;25] and k= 2;7;12. We obtain the following result:
L,k 5,2 5,7 5,12 10,2 10,7 10,12 15,2 15,7 15,12 25,2 25,7 25,12
GPT-4 92.0% 99.5% 95.9% 20.3% 34.0% 36.2% 4.3% 7.5% 30.3 12.8% 1.6% 22.0 %
TD3 39.5% 67.2% 43.0% 12.7% 31.3% 14.6% 3.9% 10.9% 5.4% 3.0% 14.5% 8.4%
While GPT-4&#x27;s counting ability has substantially improved compared to the previous model for short
sequences, a signicant drop in GPT-4&#x27;s accuracy still occurs as the sequence length grows from 5 to 10,
indicating that it has a much lower counting capacity than humans. Since counting is a basic requirement for
many applications, it may be benecial to combine such a component into the architecture.
Reverse reasoning and verication Mathematical content produced by humans often presents a
conclusion before outlining the reasoning that led to it. For example, the sentences \we will show next that
x= 0 is a solution ...&quot; or \We are going to prove the claim: AC is perpendicular to BD&quot; can appear in a math
problem&#x27;s solution. This stylistic choice can improve readability, but it poses a challenge for natural language
generation models, as it requires the model to infer the answer before producing the reasoning steps. We
observe that not only does GPT-4 adopt this style, but it has an additional related drawback: even when
it infers a clearly wrong answer at the start, it will still attempt to create justications for it,
instead of correcting it . This may again be due to the style of the training data, which mostly contains
straightforwards solutions rather than trial-and-error style discussions and it is not clear whether or not it
can be mitigated through a reinforcement learning phase (such as GPT-Instruct).
In Figure D.1, we can see that when GPT-4 starts with a wrong conclusion, this can quickly lead to very
incoherent or nonsensical content (for example, stating that 2 0 in order to justify the conclusion). The
model is conicted between making a local mistake and contradicting its own conclusion, and often favors
matching the conclusion rather than verifying the local consistency of the logic (arguably, the training data
is more likely to contain &quot;local&quot; errors in the intermediate reasoning, than steps which clearly contradict the
stated conclusion). On the other hand, if the model produces a bottom-up argument, rst writing down the
steps and only then drawing the conclusion, the performance improves signicantly. We summarize with the
following research question, inspired by this discussion:
Mathematics is often written in a dierent order than the thought process that has led to it. How
can we encourage LLMs to produce mathematical content in an order that corresponds to the
human thought process?
124</p><p>GPT-4
Prompt:
Find all positive integers xare thatx 10.
GPT-4:
There are no positive integers xthat satisfy the inequality x 10.
To see this, suppose for a contradiction that there is some positive integer xsuch thatx 10. Then adding 1 to both
sides of the inequality, we get x1. But since xis a positive integer, it must be at least 1, so the only possibility is that
x= 1. However, plugging in x= 1 into the original inequality, we get 1  10, which simplies to 0 0. This is true,
but it is not a strict inequality, so it does not satisfy the original condition. Therefore, we have reached a contradiction,
and there are no positive integers xthat satisfy x 10.
Prompt:
Find all positive integers xare thatx 10.
There is one positive integer xthat satisfy the inequality x 10.
GPT-4:
That isx= 1.
To see why, note that if x&gt;1, thenx 1&gt;0, which contradicts the inequality.
On the other hand, if x &lt;1, thenxis not a positive integer, since positive integers are greater than or equal to 1 by
denition.
Therefore,x= 1 is the only positive integer that satises the inequality x 10.
Prompt:
Find all positive integers xare thatx 10.
There are three positive integers xthat satisfy the inequality x 10.
GPT-4:
They are:
-x= 1, since 1 1 = 0 and 00.
-x= 2, since 2 1 = 1 and 10.
-x= 3, since 3 1 = 2 and 20.
Any other positive integer xwould have x 11, which would not satisfy the inequality. Therefore, the only positive
integersxthat arex 10 arex= 1;2;3.
Prompt:
Find all positive integers xare thatx 10.
We can approach the problem
GPT-4:
by rearranging the inequality as follows:
x 10
x1
This means that xmust be less than or equal to 1 to satisfy the inequality. The only positive integer that meets this
condition is x= 1. Therefore, the solution is x= 1.
Figure D.1: Starting with a wrong conclusion.
125</p><p>D.2 Further examples
In what follows, we showcase GPT-4&#x27;s performance on questions from dierent branches of mathematics. The
examples in this section are not meant to be comprehensive or representative of the model&#x27;s performance across
dierent mathematical branches or levels, but rather to give a sense of the range of the model&#x27;s capabilities.
Most questions below were composed exclusively for this study (others have been taken or translated from
online sources which appeared after the model was trained) and are therefore unlikely to have been seen by
the model during training, thereby addressing the concern that the model has simply memorized the answers.
These examples will reveal, for instance, that the model can handle geometric concepts well, despite being
a language model, and that it can engage in meaningful conversations on some specialized topics in advanced
mathematics. A comparison with ChatGPT&#x27;s performance on the same questions shows a clear improvement
in the model&#x27;s mathematical abilities.
The questions presented below vary in their level of diculty, and some of them may be slightly out of
reach for GPT-4. However, the overall level is clearly beyond the capabilities of ChatGPT. We tested these
questions with ChatGPT several times and found that the vast majority of attempts resulted in incorrect
answers. We emphasize that we collected the questions rst and then tested them on both models without
any modication, so we did not select the questions to favor GPT-4&#x27;s performance.
In most examples, the answers produced by ChatGPT exhibit a poor understanding of the mathematical
questions and concepts involved. One common characteristic of ChatGPT&#x27;s answers is that they seem to
rely on a form of &quot;template matching&quot;, where the model tries to t the question into a familiar pattern of
a structured question, but fails to do so because the question does not match the pattern. This results in
incoherent or nonsensical output that does not address the question at all. Another common characteristic of
ChatGPT&#x27;s answers is that they often contain arguments based on incorrect reasoning or irrelevant informa-
tion. The model does not seem to grasp the crux of the question or the logic behind the mathematical steps.
Even when it does suggest a correct general strategy to solve the question, it usually makes mistakes in the
implementation or the calculation. The model also tends to perform algebraic manipulations or computations
without a clear direction or purpose, leading to confusion or errors. On the other hand, the answers given by
GPT-4 are usually more coherent, accurate, and relevant to the question. They demonstrate a better under-
standing of the mathematical concepts and methods involved, and provide clear and logical explanations and
justications for their steps and solutions.
We do not attempt to analyze the reasons for ChatGPT&#x27;s failure or GPT-4&#x27;s success in these examples,
but we provide a brief commentary for each example, where we evaluate the models&#x27; answers as if they were
written by a human. We try to point out the aspects of comprehension or insight, or the lack thereof, that
are demonstrated by the answers.
D.2.1 Algebra
The following question is advanced high-school level in mathematics, and relies on knowledge of the concepts
of function composition and inversion.
126</p><p>GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt:
Supposeg(x) =f 1(x);g(0) = 5;g(4) = 7;g(3) = 2;g(7) = 9;g(9) = 6 what is f(f(f(6)))?
GPT-4:
There are dierent ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is to use the fact that g(x) =f 1(x)
implies that f(g(x)) =xfor anyxin the domain of g. That is, applying fto both sides of the equation g(x) =f 1(x)
givesf(g(x)) =f(f 1(x)) =x. This means that we can undo the eect of fby applying g, and vice versa.
Using this idea, we can try to nd f(6) by looking for the value of x such that g(x) = 6. From the given information,
we see that g(9) = 6, sof(6) =f(g(9)) = 9. Similarly, we can nd f(9) by looking for the value of xsuch thatg(x) = 9.
We see that g(7) = 9, so f(9) =f(g(7)) = 7. Finally, we can nd f(7) by looking for the value of xsuch thatg(x) = 7.
We see that g(4) = 7, so f(7) =f(g(4)) = 4.
Therefore,f(f(f(6))) =f(f(9)) =f(7) = 4.
ChatGPT:
We know that g(x) =f 1(x), sof(f 1(x)) =x. Therefore, we have
f(f(f(6))) =f(f(g(9))) =f(f(6)) =f(g(7)) =f(9):
The solution given by GPT-4 is correct and the argument is sound, while ChatGPT produces an incorrect
solution which (in the case of a human) would reect a lack of understanding of the concept of function
inversion.
In the next example, both models produce a wrong answer. The argument produced by GPT-4 actually
has the correct answer hidden in it, but it still gives a wrong bottom line (perhaps because it begins by stating
a wrong answer). The argument produced by ChatGPT is mostly incoherent.
127</p><p>GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt:
Take a number x, and then apply an iterative procedure where each iteration multiplies the previous number by 2 and
then subtract 1 from it. What is the condition on the starting number, xso that at some point we reach a number
higher than 1000?
GPT-4:
There is no condition on the starting number xthat is necessary in order to eventually reach a number higher than 1000.
No matter what number we start with, repeated application of the procedure (multiply by 2, subtract 1) will eventually
yield a number greater than 1000.
To see why, note that each time we apply the procedure, the number either stays the same (if we started with x= 1) or
it increases. Specically, if we start with a number x&gt;1, then after applying the procedure we will have:
2x 1&gt;2x 2 =x+x&gt;x
So the number increases with each iteration. As a result, no matter what number we start with, we will eventually
surpass any nite target (such as 1000).
ChatGPT:
At each iteration, the number xis multiplied by 2 and then subtracted by 1. Hence, after niterations, the result is:
xn= 2n(x) (2n 1)
The number xnwill be greater than 1000 if 2n(x) (2n 1)&gt;1000, which can be rearranged to:
2n(x)&gt;1001 + (2n 1)
2n(x)&gt;2n
x&gt;2n 1
So, the condition for the starting number xto reach a number greater than 1000 after niterations is that x &gt;2n 1.
Forn= 10, we have 210 1= 512, sox&gt;512 is a sucient condition for xn&gt;1000.
The next question is fairly simple. In order to solve it, one needs to simplify an equation in a straight-
forward way, after which one is only left with an equation involving terms x0; X4andx8, at which point one
can realize that this is a quadratic equation in x4which can be solved by substitution.
128</p><p>GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt:
Find the real roots to x8 2x4 7 = (x+ 1)2 x2 2x:
GPT-4:
Simplify the equation by moving everything to one side:
x8 2x4 7 (x+ 1)2+x2+ 2x= 0
Expanding and combining like terms, we get:
x8 2x4 7 x2 2x 1 +x2+ 2x= 0
x8 2x4 8 = 0
To nd the real roots, we can try to factor this polynomial. One way to do this is to make a substitution, such as
u=x4. Then the equation becomes: u2 2u 8 = 0. This is a quadratic equation in u, which we can factor as:
(u 4)(u+ 2) = 0. Then we can solve for uby setting each factor to zero:
u 4 = 0 =)u= 4
u+ 2 = 0 =)u= 2
Now we can substitute back x4foruand solve for x:
x4= 4 =)x=4p
41:414
x4= 2 =)x=4p
 2
However, the second equation has no real solutions, since we cannot take an even root of a negative number. Therefore,
the only real roots are:
x1:414
ChatGPT:
We can rewrite the given equation as
(x2+ 1)2 x2 2x=x8 2x4 7;
so
(x2+ 1)2 2x=x8 2x4 7 +x2:
Then
(x2+ 1)2 2x x2=x8 2x4 7;
so
(x2+ 1 x)2=x8 2x4 7:
We can factor the right side as ( x4 1)(x4+ 7);so
(x2+ 1 x)2= (x4 1)(x4+ 7):
Ifx4 1 = 0;thenx= 1:Otherwise, x4+ 7 = 0;sox=i4p
7:
Thus, the roots are x= 1;i4p
7:
GPT-4 gives a correct solution while ChatGPT begins by rearranging the terms without any clear direc-
tion or purpose, and ends up with an incorrect solution.
Our nal example involves high-school level trigonometry question that has been translated from the 2022
Chinese College Entrance Exam problems.
129</p><p>GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt:
If sin(a+b) =xand cos(a) =y, what is sin( a b) in terms of x;yassuming sin( a), sin(b), cos(a), cos(b) are all positive?
GPT-4:
There are a couple of ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is to use the sum and dierence formulas
for sine and cosine and the Pythagorean identity 1 = sin2(t) + cos2(t) for any angle t. Here are the steps:
- Start with the given equation sin( a+b) =xand apply the sum formula: sin( a+b) = sin(a) cos(b) + cos(a) sin(b) =x
- Rearrange the equation to isolate sin( b):sin(b) = (x sin(a) cos(b))=cos(a)
- Use the Pythagorean identity to nd cos( b) in terms of sin( b): cos2(b) = 1 sin2(b) = 1 ((x sin(a) cos(b))=cos(a))2
- Simplify the expression for cos2(b) by multiplying both sides by cos2(a) and expanding the square:
cos2(a) cos2(b) = cos2(a) (x sin(a) cos(b))2= cos2(a) x2+ 2xsin(a) cos(b) sin2(a) cos2(b)
- Collect the terms with cos2(b) on one side and factor out cos2(b): cos2(b)(cos2(a) + sin2(a)) =
cos2(a) x2+ 2xsin(a) cos(b)
- Use the Pythagorean identity again to simplify the factor cos2(a) + sin2(a) = 1: cos2(b) = (cos2(a) x2+
2xsin(a) cos(b))=(cos2(a) + sin2(a)) = (cos2(a) x2+ 2xsin(a) cos(b))=1
- Rearrange the equation to isolate cos( b): cos2(b) 2xsin(a) cos(b) +x2 cos2(a) = 0
- Use the quadratic formula to solve for cos( b): cos(b) = (2xsin(a)p
(2xsin(a))2 4(1)(x2 cos2(a)))=(2(1)) =
(xsin(a)p
cos2(a) x2+x2sin2(a))=1
- Since we are assuming cos( b) is positive, we choose the positive sign for the square root: cos( b) =
xsin(a) +p
cos2(a) x2+x2sin2(a)
- Now we have expressions for both sin( b) and cos(b) in terms of x,y, and sin(a), so we can use the dierence formula
for sine to nd sin( a b): sin(a b) = sin(a) cos(b) cos(a) sin(b)
- Substitute the expressions for sin(b) andcos(b) and simplify: sin( a b) = sin(a)(xsin(a)+p
cos2(a) x2+x2sin2(a)) 
cos(a)((x sin(a)(xsin(a) +p
cos2(a) x2+x2sin2(a)))=cos(a))
...
ChatGPT:
To nd sin( a b) in terms of x,yassuming sin( a), sin(b), cos(a), cos(b) are all positive, we can use the identity:
sin(a b) = sin(a) cos(b) cos(a) sin(b)
Since sin(a) and cos(a) are both positive, we can substitute the given value of xfor sin(a+b) and the given value of y
for cos(a) to get:
sin(a b) =xcos(b) ysin(b)
This gives us an expression for sin( a b) in terms of x,y.
In the above, both models reach an incorrect answer. The argument by GPT-4 is based on correct
reasoning but has several calculation mistakes, whereas the argument by ChapGPT contains mostly invalid
reasoning steps.
D.2.2 Geometry
It is reasonable to assume that geometric math questions would pose a more substantial challenge for language
models. Nonetheless, it is possible for GPT-4 to successfully address certain questions which would typically
necessitate a diagram or illustration, as shown next.
Our rst example requires basic knowledge in vector calculus.
130</p><p>GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt:
In a triangle ABC ,Dis on the edge AB,jDBj= 2jDAj. Suppose ~CA=m;~CD=n, what is~CB?
GPT-4:
There are a couple of ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is to use vector addition and subtraction.
We can write:
~CB=~CA+~AB (1)
and
~AB=~AD+~DB (2)
Using the given information that jDBj= 2jDAj, we can also write:
~DB= 2~AD (3)
Substituting (3) into (2), we get:
~AB=~AD+ 2~AD= 3~AD (4)
Substituting (4) into (1), we get:
~CB=~CA+ 3~AD (5)
Now, we can use the fact that ~CD=nto write:~CD=~CA+~AD (6). Solving for ~AD, we get:
~AD=~CD ~CA=n m (7)
Substituting (7) into (5), we get:
~CB=~CA+ 3(n m) (8)
Simplifying, we get:
~CB=m+ 3n 3m (9)
~CB= 2m+ 3n (10)
This is the nal answer.
ChatGPT:
Let&#x27;s call the length of segment AB x . Then the length of segment ADisx=3 and the length of segment DBis 2x=3.
SinceDis a point on line AB, we can write the following equation: n+m=x.
Since the length of segment ADisx=3 and the length of segment DBis 2x=3, we can write the following equation:
m+n=x=3 + 2x=3 =x
Solving the system of equations, we get:
m= 2x=3
n=x=3
Therefore, the vector CBis equal to the negative of the vector CA, or 2x=3.
GPT-4 obtains the correct solution, associating the geometric objects described in the question with the
vector notation and performing manipulations on these vectors. ChatGPT, near the beginning of the solution,
writes the equation n+m=xwhich compares vectors and scalars (which is incoherent).
The following question relies on the application of basic geometric concepts such as the Pythagorean
theorem.
131</p><p>GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt:
In a perfect square ABCD ,jABj=jBCj=jCDj=jDAj,Eis the middle point of AD,Fis the middle point of EB.
SupposejBFj= 6, what is the area of ABCD ?
GPT-4:
There are a couple of ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is to use the Pythagorean theorem.
We can observe that triangle ABE is a right triangle, with AEandABas the legs and EBas the hypotenuse.
Since E is the middle point of AD, we havejAEj=jEDj=jABj=2.
Since F is the middle point of EB, we havejBFj=jFEj=jEBj=2.
We are given that jBFj= 6, so we can deduce that jEBj= 12.
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can nd jABjby solving:
jABj2+jAEj2=jEBj2
jABj2+ (jABj=2)2= 122
jABj2+jABj2=4 = 144
5jABj2=4 = 144
jABj2= 1444=5
jABj2= 115:2
jABj=p
115:2
jABj= 10:72(approximate)
Now that we have jABj, we can nd the area of ABCD by squaring it, since ABCD is a perfect square.
Area ofABCD =jABj2
Area ofABCD = 10:722
Area ofABCD = 114:92 (approximate)
Therefore, the area of ABCD is about 114.92 square units.
ChatGPT:
SinceEis the midpoint of AD,AE =ED. Similarly, since Fis the midpoint of EB,EF =FB. Therefore,
AE=ED=EF=FB. It follows that triangle AEF is an isosceles triangle with AFas the base and AEandEFas
the equal legs.
SinceAF= 12 (the side length of the square), the area of triangle AEF is 36. Since triangle AEF is half of the area of
squareABCD , the area of square ABCD is 236 = 72. Therefore, the area of ABCD is 72.
In this example, one needs to rst realize that the Pythogorean theorem is required and nd the triangle
on which it needs to be applied, which GPT-4 does correctly (and later on correctly employs geometric con-
cepts such as the area of a perfect square and the midpoint of a line segment). Curiously, note that it takes
the square root of 115 and later takes the square of that number, using numerical estimates thus arriving
at a slightly innacurate number, rather than realizing that these estimates are unnecessary. Once again, the
output of ChatGPT is incoherent.
The following question is quite simple, though unstructured, and relies on the understanding of the concept
of equivalence up to translations and rotations.
132</p><p>GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt:
LetA;B;C;D be four points on the plane. Suppose that the points A;B;C form the vertices of an equilateral triangle
and that the distance between AandDis equal to the distance between B and D, which is equal to two thirds of
the distance between A and B. How many dierent congurations which satisfy this are there up to rotation and dilation?
The following question is rather simple, but one would typically need an illustration. GPT-4:
There are two dierent congurations which satisfy this up to rotation and dilation. One way to see this is to use
complex numbers to represent the points on the plane. Let A= 0,B= 1, andC= (1=2) + (p
3)=2)ibe the vertices of
an equilateral triangle with unit side length. Then the point Dmust satisfyjDj= 2=3 andjD 1j= 2=3, which implies
thatDis either (1=3) + (p
3)=3)ior (1=3) (p
3)=3)i, depending on whether Dlies inside or outside the triangle. These
two choices correspond to the two congurations, and any other conguration can be obtained by rotating or dilating
these two.
ChatGPT:
There are exactly two dierent congurations up to rotation and dilation which satisfy the given conditions.
The rst conguration is when point D is the midpoint of one of the sides of the equilateral triangle formed by A, B,
and C. In this case, the distance between A and D, as well as the distance between B and D, will be equal to one-third
of the distance between A and B.
The second conguration is when point D is the centroid of the equilateral triangle. In this case, the distance between
A and D, as well as the distance between B and D, will be equal to two-thirds of the distance between A and B.
Therefore, there are exactly two dierent congurations which satisfy the given conditions.
Here, both models give a correct nal answer. However, scrutiny of ChatGPT&#x27;s argument reveals that it
is invalid, and points to a lack of comprehension the geometry underlying the problem.
D.2.3 Calculus
The next exercise, which involves the calculation of an integral, is typical of undergraduate calculus classes
in STEM subjects.
133</p><p>GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt:
What is the intergal of ln(cos( x)) xtan(x)?
GPT-4:
We can split the integral of ln(cos( x)) xtan(x) into two parts:
Z
ln(cos(x)) xtan(x)dx=Z
ln(cos(x))dx Z
xtan(x)dx
To nd the rst part, we can use integration by parts, which states that:
Z
udv=uv Z
vdu
Letu= ln(cos(x)) anddv=dx. Thendu= sin(x)
cos(x)dx= tan(x)dxandv=x. Substituting these into the formula,
we get:
Z
ln(cos(x))dx=xln(cos(x)) +Z
xtan(x)dx
So the rst part is equal to the second part plus xln(cos(x)). This means we can simplify the original integral as:
Z
ln(cos(x)) xtan(x)dx=xln(cos(x)) +Z
xtan(x)dx Z
xtan(x)dx=xln(cos(x)) +C
whereCis an arbitrary constant of integration. Therefore, the answer is:
Z
ln(cos(x)) xtan(x)dx=xln(cos(x)) +C
ChatGPT:
To nd the indenite integral of ln(cos( x)) xtan(x), we can use the following steps:
Use the identity tan( x) =sin(x)
cos(x)to rewrite the expression as ln(cos( x)) xsin(x)
cos(x).
Use the identity ln( ab) = ln(a) + ln(b) to rewrite the expression as ln(cos( x)) ln(cos(x)) xsin(x)
cos(x).
Combine the two logarithms using the identity ln( a) ln(b) = ln a

to get lncos(x)

Simplify the fractioncos(x)

cos(x).
Use the identity ln(1) = 0 to simplify the expression to 0  xsin(x)
cos(x).
Use the identity ln( an) =nln(a) to rewrite the expression as  xln(cos(x)).
Use the identity ln(cos( x)) = ln(jcos(x)j) +iArg(cos(x)) to rewrite the expression as  x(ln(jcos(x)j) +iArg(cos(x))).
The indenite integral of ln(cos( x)) xtan(x) is therefore x(ln(jcos(x)j) +iArg(cos(x))) +C, whereCis a constant
of integration.
GPT-4 applies the integration by parts technique, which is based on a successful decision of splitting the
integral into two parts, reaching a correct solution. ChatGPT applied several identities without an apparent
purpose, makes several mistakes on the way and arrives at a wrong result.
We continue to another typical college-level calculus example, which deals with the dierentiation of an
implicit function.
134</p><p>GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt:
Ifxy= ln(x+y), what isdy
dx?
GPT-4:
There are dierent methods to nddy
dx, but one possible way is to use implicit dierentiation. Implicit dierentiation is
a technique that allows us to dierentiate both sides of an equation with respect to x, and then solve fordy
dxby isolating
it. Here are the steps:
- Dierentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, using the product rule, the chain rule, and the derivative of
ln(u) =u0=u.
xy= ln(x+y)
dxy
dx=d
dxln(x+y) =(x+y)0
x+y=1 +dy
dx
x+y
- Use the product rule to expanddxy
dx=x0y+xy0.x0y+xy0=y+xdy
dx:
- Substitute the expression fordxy
dxfrom step 1 into the equation from step 2 and simplify.
(y+xdy
dx) = (1 +dy
dx)=(x+y)
(x+y)(y+xdy
dx) = 1 +dy
dx
xy+y2+x2dy
dx+xydy
dx= 1 +dy
dx
x2dy
dx+xydy
dx dy
dx= 1 xy y2
dy
dx(x2+xy 1) = 1 xy y2
- Solve fordy
dxby dividing both sides by the coecient ofdy
dx.dy
dx=1 xy y2
x2+xy 1
ChatGPT:
To nd the derivative of ywith respect to x, we can use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if yis a function of
u, anduis a function of x, then the derivative of ywith respect to xis equal to the derivative of ywith respect to u
multiplied by the derivative of uwith respect to x.
In this case, we can let u=x+y. Thenyis a function of u, sincey= ln(u). The derivative of ywith respect to uis
1=u, since the derivative of ln( u) is 1=u.
The derivative of uwith respect to xis 1, sinceu=x+yand the derivative of a constant is 0. Therefore, the derivative
ofywith respect to xis:dy
dx= (1=u)(1) =1
x+y
GPT-4 correctly applies implicit dierentiation, which accounts for the dependency of the derivatives in
yandx. ChatGPT&#x27;s response starts with &quot;we can use the chain rule&quot;, which is irrelevant to this question,
and continues with a mostly incoherent argument.
The last question in this subsection is an exercise in calculus of variations (typically taught in rst year
undergraduate in STEM subjects):
135</p><p>GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
Prompt:
LetPbe a point on the hyperbola x2+3xy+4x 5y= 9y2 133:Find the shortest possible distance from the origin to P:
GPT-4:
There are dierent methods to approach this problem, but one possible way is to use calculus. We can try to minimize
the distance function square d2=x2+y2subject to the constraint x2+ 3xy+ 4x 5y= 9y2 133:To do this, we
can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, which says that if d2has a local extremum at a point ( x;y) that satises
the constraint, then there exists a constant such that the gradient of d2is parallel to the gradient of the constraint,
or equivalently,
rd2=rg;
whereg(x;y) =x2+ 3xy+ 4x 5y+ 9y2+ 133 is the constraint function. The gradient of a function is a vector of its
partial derivatives, so we have
rd2= (2x;2y) andrg= (2x+ 3y+ 4;3x 5 + 18y):
Equating the components of these vectors, we get the system of equations
(
2x=(2x+ 3y+ 4)
2y=(3x 5 + 18y)
Moreover, we also have the constraint equation
x2+ 3xy+ 4x 5y= 9y2 133:
We can try to solve this system of three equations in three unknowns ( x;y; ) ...
ChatGPT:
We can write the equation of the hyperbola in standard form as
x2+ 4x 9y2
4 5y
3= 1:
To nd the distance from the origin to a point on the hyperbola, we can use the distance formula:
d=q
(x 0)2+ (y 0)2:
Substituting the coordinates of the point ( x;y) into this formula, we get
d=p
x2+y2:
We want to minimize this distance subject to the constraint that the point lies on the hyperbola. This leads us to the
following optimization problem:
Minimizep
x2+y2subject tox2+4x 9y2
4 5y
3= 1:
We can write this as a Lagrange optimization problem by introducing a Lagrange multiplier :
Minimizep

4 5y
3 (p
x2+y2 d) = 0:
Setting the partial derivatives of this expression with respect to x; y; andequal to 0, we get the system of equations
x
2+ 2x= 0;
y
2 5= 0;
p
x2+y2 d= 0:
Both models realize that the method of Lagrange multipliers is useful in this question (this strategy is
relevant for questions involving minimizing a certain expression under a constraint). While ChatGPT applies
this method in an incorrect way (which, in case of a human, could be considered as a lack of comprehension),
GPT-4 produces a sound argument.
136</p><p>D.2.4 Mathematical modeling
We give two examples that combine knowledge in physics combined with some common-sense assumptions.

GPT-4:
- The volume of the egg is V= (4=3)r3, whereris the radius. Plugging in r= 10cm, we get V= 4188:79cm3. - The
density of pure gold is = 19:3g=cm3, so the mass of the egg is m=V. Plugging in the values, we get m = 80834.65
g, or about 80.8 kg.
- The tensile strength of a typical plastic bag is = 20 MPa, or 20N =mm2, which means it can withstand a force of 20
N per square millimeter of cross-sectional area before breaking. The thickness of a typical plastic bag is t= 0.01 mm,
or 0.001 cm, so the cross-sectional area of a plastic bag is A=wt, wherewis the width. Assuming that the plastic bag
is rectangular and has a width of 30 cm, we get A= 0:3cm2.
- The force exerted by the weight of the egg is F=mg, wheregis the acceleration due to gravity. Assuming that
g= 9:8m=s2, we getF= 791:62N.
- The number of plastic bags needed to hold the egg is n=F=(A), whereAis the maximum force that one plastic
bag can withstand. Plugging in the values, we get n= 791:62=(201060:3) = 0:00132, or about 0 :001 bags.
However, this answer is not very realistic, because it implies that a fraction of a plastic bag can hold the egg, and that
the plastic bag can stretch innitely without losing strength. A more practical answer would take into account some
factors such as: The shape and size of the plastic bag, and how well it can t the egg without leaving too much empty
space or creating too much stress at the corners or edges. The elasticity and durability of the plastic bag, and how
much it can stretch or deform before breaking or tearing. The safety factor, or the ratio of the actual strength to the
required strength, that is needed to account for possible variations in the quality of the plastic bag, the distribution of
the weight of the egg, the impact of external forces, and the margin of error. The convenience and comfort of carrying
the egg, and how many plastic bags can be easily handled without slipping, dropping, or hurting the hands.
Depending on these factors, the number of plastic bags needed to hold the egg could vary signicantly, but a reasonable
estimate might be somewhere between 10 and 20 bags, assuming that each bag can hold about 5 to 10 kg of weight,
and that a safety factor of 2 to 4 is applied.
ChatGPT:
To build a mathematical model to solve this problem, we rst need to determine the volume of the egg. We can
do this using the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is: V= (4=3)r3whereVis the volume of the
sphere,is approximately 3.14, and ris the radius of the sphere. Plugging in the values from the problem, we get:
V= (4=3)3:14(10cm)3= 4:19cm3. Next, we need to determine the volume of a single plastic bag that you will use
to hold the egg. Let&#x27;s assume that each bag has a volume of 1 liter, or 1000 cm3. Now, we can divide the volume of the
egg by the volume of a single bag to determine how many bags we will need: Number of bags = V(egg)=V(bag) = 4.19
cm3/ 1000 cm3= 0.00419 bags Since we cannot use a fraction of a bag, we will need to round up to the nearest whole
number, so we will need at least 1 plastic bag to hold the egg.
Note that ChatGPT fails to account for the weight factor and bases its answer solely on volume calcu-
lations. While volume is the most common concern when determining the number of bags needed in day to
day life, it is not relevant to this question. GPT-4, in contrast, correctly addresses the crux of this question
by creating a physical model of the object&#x27;s weight and estimating the maximum weight a plastic bag could
hold. The nal answer is still wrong, however, due to calculation mistakes.
Our second question relies on the understanding of concepts of heat conductance and radiation.

Prompt:
How fast does an iron ball whose radius is 1 meter need to move, in order to get to a distance of 1km from the sun
before melting?
GPT-4:
There are a few dierent ways to approach this question, but one possible method is to use the following assumptions
and simplications:
- The iron ball is spherical, homogeneous, and has a density of 7 :8g=cm3and a melting point of 1538 °C.
- The iron ball starts from the Earth&#x27;s orbit, which has a mean distance of 149.6 million km from the sun and a mean
orbital speed of 29.8 km/s.
- The iron ball follows a straight-line trajectory towards the sun, ignoring the eects of gravity, drag, radiation, and
other celestial bodies.
- The iron ball heats up due to the solar radiation, which has an average intensity of 1361W =m2at the Earth&#x27;s orbit
and follows an inverse square law with distance.
- The iron ball has a specic heat capacity of 0.45 J/g °C and a latent heat of fusion of 247 J/g.
- The iron ball does not lose heat by conduction, convection, or radiation, and its temperature is uniform throughout.
Using these assumptions, we can calculate the time it takes for the iron ball to reach the sun and the temperature it
reaches at dierent distances. We can also compare the temperature with the melting point and nd the distance at
which the iron ball melts.
The time it takes for the iron ball to reach the sun is given by: t=d=vwhere d is the distance from the sun and vis
the speed of the iron ball. Assuming the iron ball starts from the Earth&#x27;s orbit, we have: t= 149:6 million km =v. The
temperature of the iron ball at a given distance is given by: T=T0+Q=mc whereT0is the initial temperature, Qis
the heat absorbed by the iron ball, mis the mass of the iron ball, and cis the specic heat capacity of iron. Assuming
the iron ball starts at 15 °C, we have:
T= 15C+Q=(4=3137:81060:45)
The heat absorbed by the iron ball at time tis given by: Q(t) =P(t)AwhereP(t) is the power of the solar radiation at
timetandAis the cross-sectional area of the iron ball. Assuming the iron ball has a radius of 1 m, we have A=12.
The power of the solar radiation at time t is given by: P(t) =I(t)A(1 a) whereI(t) is the intensity of the solar
radiation at time tandais the albedo of the iron ball, which is the fraction of the radiation that is reected. Assuming
the iron ball has an albedo of 0.1, we have: P(t) =I(t)120:9. The intensity of the solar radiation at time t is
given by:
I(t) =I0(r0=r(t))2
whereI0is the intensity of the solar radiation at the Earth&#x27;s orbit, r0is the distance of the Earth&#x27;s orbit from the sun,
andr(t) is the distance of the iron ball from the sun at time t. Assuming I0= 1361W=m2andr0= 149:6 million km,
we have:
I(t) = 1361W=m2(149:6 million km =(149:6 million km vt))2
Taking integral over 0 to t, we can nd the total heat absorbed by the iron ball at time t:
Q=Zt
0Q(t)dt=Zt
0P(t)Adt:
...
ChatGPT:
We can start by using the equation for kinetic energy to determine the speed of the iron ball. Kinetic energy is given
by the equation: KE = 1 =2mv2where KE is the kinetic energy, mis the mass of the iron ball, and vis its velocity.
Since we want the iron ball to be able to travel 1 km closer to the Sun without melting, we can assume that its kinetic
energy will be equal to the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of the iron ball by its melting point.
Next, we will use the formula for heat energy which is Q=mcTwhere Q is heat energy, m is the mass, c is the specic
heat of the substance and  Tis the temperature change. We can then equate the two equations to nd the velocity
required. 1=2mv2=mcTSolving for v,v=p

D.3 Generating math problems with GPT-4
Next, we use GPT-4 to generate new math problems based on existing ones under some natural language
constraints, according to the following categories:
1. Content modication: A problem that has the same structure and logic as the original one, but with
138</p><p>dierent names, objects, or values.
2. Diculty enhancement: Modifying a problem in a way that it becomes more challenging than the
original one, for example by adding more steps or constraints or increasing the complexity.
We provide one example for each type.

price, how much prot would they make if they split the prots equally among themselves?
D.4 Mitigating calculation errors via external code execution
As we have seen above, a main reason for the model&#x27;s failure to solve mathematical questions can be attributed
to calculation errors. The following example is a proof of concept showing that, instead of carrying out a
139</p><p>certain calculation, the model can be prompted to produce a segment of code which performs the it. By
combining the model with an external component that executes code (concatenating the result to the prompt
after execution), we speculate that many of the errors can be mitigated, however, we did not conduct a
systematic evaluation of this approach.

GPT-4
The following is an IM chat sequence. You are an astrophysicist.
USER: &quot;Why the sky is blue?&quot;&lt;|endofprompt|&gt;
YOU: &quot;The sky is blue because of the way sunlight interacts with the molecules of air in the Earth&#x27;s
atmosphere. Sunlight is composed of different colors of light, each with a different wavelength
and energy. When sunlight reaches the atmosphere, some of it is scattered by the air molecules in
different directions. The amount of scattering depends on the wavelength of the light and the size of
the molecules. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and higher energy than red light, and it is scattered
more by the small molecules of nitrogen and oxygen that make up most of the air. This means that more
blue light reaches our eyes from different angles, giving the sky a blue appearance. Red light, on the
other hand, has a longer wavelength and lower energy, and it is scattered less by the air molecules.
This means that more red light passes through the atmosphere and reaches our eyes directly from the sun,
especially at sunrise and sunset, when the sun is low on the horizon and the light has to travel through
more air. This gives the sun a reddish hue and the sky a reddish or orange tint.&quot;

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.
You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a yellow onion, an orange bell pepper, a carrot and a raw pork
chop. You make out an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! Its a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a
knife. As if things werent amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can make out a green apple, a red hot
pepper, a tomato and a cookbook. It doesnt get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is
empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?
There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the north. Dont worry, there is no door. You dont like doors? Why not try
going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
